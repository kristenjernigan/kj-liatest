## Module 1 Sprint 3

## Introduction to the Digital Service Tech Bootcamp

Modern government acquisition professionals operate in a rapidly evolving digital environment. Whether you're evaluating a cloud-based platform, reviewing a data-sharing agreement, or procuring custom software development, your work increasingly intersects with key technology concepts that shape how agencies deliver public services.

This module introduces five essential digital service topics—data, software, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity—with a focus on how these topics directly impact your role as an acquisition professional. 

* Data is the foundation of digital services; it's collected, stored, and analyzed to inform decisions, measure impact, and improve government operations. Procurement supports this by sourcing tools and services for managing and protecting data.  
* Software refers to the programs that run on computers or in the cloud to help agencies operate efficiently. Procurement plays a key role in acquiring, licensing, and maintaining the right software to meet mission needs.  
* Cloud services allow agencies to rent computing power, storage, and tools over the internet instead of maintaining physical servers. Procurement must structure contracts to align with flexible, scalable cloud service models.  
* Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI uses algorithms to analyze data, automate tasks, and generate insights that support faster, smarter decisions. Procurement may support AI initiatives by acquiring ethical, compliant AI tools and ensuring proper data use.  
* Cybersecurity protects government systems and data from threats like hacking or data breaches. Procurement ensures that systems and services meet security standards and include appropriate safeguards.

You don't need to be a technical expert, but understanding the fundamentals will help you write better requirements, evaluate vendor capabilities, and ensure contracts support secure, effective, and user-centered digital services.

The lessons ahead will explain terminology, describe modern delivery models, and highlight practical implications for acquisition planning, vendor engagement, and contract oversight.

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Describe the differences between structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data, and explain why those distinctions matter for procurement and contract oversight.

* Identify key challenges and modernization needs related to data storage, migration, analytics, and privacy in federal systems.

* Explain the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and modern practices like Agile, DevOps (development and operations), and Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), and recognize their relevance in acquisition strategies.

* Differentiate between proprietary and open-source software licenses, and understand the implications of software supply chain security.

* Define cloud computing and distinguish between public, private, community, and hybrid cloud deployment models.

* Explain the differences between Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), and assess what kind of cloud service model a contract may require.

* Recognize cloud-specific procurement considerations, including pricing models, shared security responsibilities, vendor lock-in risks, and Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) compliance.

* Understand the basics of cybersecurity as it applies to acquisitions, including compliance frameworks (e.g., National Institute of Standards and Technology \[NIST\]), identity and access management (IAM), vulnerability management, and Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM).
