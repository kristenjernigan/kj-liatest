# Module 4 Sprint 1

## Managing Digital Service Delivery

The contract has been awarded. Now what?

In many traditional acquisitions, the role of the Contracting Officer (CO) winds down significantly after award. But when it comes to digital service procurements—especially those that use agile delivery methods—award is just the beginning. Your engagement in the post-award phase can directly influence the success of the product being built.

In this module, we’ll explore how Contracting Officers can play an active, valuable role during the delivery phase of a digital service contract. You’ll learn how to work effectively with the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) and the Product Owner (PO), understand what product management means in this context, and recognize how agile delivery teams operate once the work begins.

Your continued involvement matters. Agile product delivery thrives when all parts of the acquisition team remain connected throughout the contract. As the CO, you’re uniquely positioned to be the team’s “barrier remover,” helping identify and resolve issues early, manage contractual risks, and make sure the contract flexes with the needs of the project—all while staying compliant and goal-oriented.

This sprint will help you recognize:

* What product ownership looks like in federal digital service delivery  
* How CORs and POs interact and support agile delivery  
* Why communication rhythms, shared understanding, and rituals matter  
* How to help your team celebrate progress and spot success

### Building products, not just deliverables

Unlike traditional acquisitions where the contract often focuses on fixed requirements and final deliverables, digital service contracts are built around product delivery. That means continuous development of something usable—a tool, system, or experience—that supports an end-user need or mission goal.

This is not a “set it and forget it” process. Agile work requires iteration: building, testing, learning, adjusting. It’s dynamic and human-centered. The Product Owner works closely with the development team to prioritize what gets built and why. The COR helps ensure government oversight, risk management, and performance tracking. And you—the CO—play a crucial role in keeping everything on the rails from a contractual perspective.

This collaborative structure depends on communication. Unlike other contracts, it’s not uncommon for team members—including junior developers, designers, and technical leads—to engage with the program regularly. These touchpoints foster transparency, help resolve issues quickly, and drive stronger outcomes.

### Laying the Groundwork for Success

The first few times you manage a digital service delivery, it may feel unfamiliar. That’s okay. It’s not about getting everything perfect upfront—it’s about building shared understanding and accountability.

Start by getting clear on roles and expectations:

* What does the Product Owner need to make good decisions?  
* What information does the COR need to document performance?  
* What’s your role when roadblocks appear or contractual questions arise?

Before the contractor team even kicks off, consider establishing a project charter or communication plan that outlines how you’ll work together. These can be lightweight but powerful tools that define:

* What success looks like  
* How progress will be tracked  
* Who owns decisions at different stages  
* How and when to escalate concerns  
* How you’ll celebrate wins—and how you’ll course-correct if needed

Remember: this stage is about delivery, but it’s also about learning, improving, and staying connected to the people and goals you’re serving. Agile contracts have shown up to three times higher success rates than traditional waterfall efforts—because of this continuous involvement, shared accountability, and focus on delivering real, working results.

See the attached Sample Project Charter for a template to kick off this process  
[Project Charter](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/00b8215fd4a12737c71e676ceb10f7f949fa79cb/Media/Module%204/Digital%20Service%20Delivery%20Project%20Charter%20.docx)

### Agile Rituals and Procurement Alignment

To better understand how agile delivery unfolds in a federal environment, the following example illustrates a typical one-month Scrum schedule. It highlights key touchpoints for the Product Owner (PO), Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR), and Contracting Officer (CO), showing how agile rituals align with government oversight responsibilities. While each contract may require adjustments based on its complexity, mission, or team dynamics, this structure offers a foundational model. By starting with a simple, well-understood rhythm, teams can more confidently adapt when exceptions or project-specific needs arise.

#### One-Month Agile Ritual Scenario (with Pre-Sprint Activities)

**Structure:** 2-week sprints over 4 weeks, including product demo and CO/COR/PO check-in  
**Purpose:** Demonstrate how agile ceremonies align with federal procurement oversight roles and responsibilities

![Infographic titled 'Basic Scrum Cadence' showing a weekly schedule for three sprints (Sprint 1, Sprint 2, Sprint 3). Each week (Monday to Friday) includes 'Daily Scrum'. On Tuesday, 'Backlog refinement' is added. On Wednesday, 'Sprint review', 'Retrospective', and 'Sprint Planning' are added. Arrows indicate flow between days, showing the continuous nature of Daily Scrums.](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/724b890d63e87770de78ae7ab3b4c10f3ec4adf4/Media/Module%204/basic%20scrum%20cadence.png)

##### **Pre-Sprint Activities (Before Week 1 and Before Week 3\)**

**Participants:** Vendor team, Product Owner (PO), COR (observer), technical stakeholders  
**Activities:**

* **User Story Sizing:**  
   The vendor team reviews upcoming stories with the PO and provides rough estimates of effort (e.g., story points or time-based sizing).
  
 ![Infographic titled 'Epic/story pointing and relativity'. It illustrates functionality/issues as different-sized boxes, each paired with a silhouette of a person. These correspond to 'Relative difference' (Smallest to Biggest) and 'Story pointing' values (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13). Below, a graph shows 'Uncertainty' increasing proportionally as 'Story Points' increase, with text stating 'Uncertainty of completion increases in proportion to story point increases'.](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/724b890d63e87770de78ae7ab3b4c10f3ec4adf4/Media/Module%204/epic%20-%20story%20pointing%20and%20relativity.png) 
  *Image Credit: Blackboard PISG Agile and Scrum Training 2018*
  

* **Backlog Refinement:**  
  Based on the sizing and team velocity, the PO re-prioritizes the backlog and adjusts scope.
  
 ![Diagram titled 'Discovering and defining the backlog'. On the left, 'Product Backlog' shows a 'Theme' containing multiple 'Epics'. A Product Manager (PM, Visionary) is shown above, and a Product Owner (PO, Execution) below. Black arrows show the PM and PO influencing the creation of a 'Prioritized Product Backlog' on the right, which breaks down Epics into 'Stories' for Sprint 1, 2, and 3, with some Epics remaining for refinement or later sprints. A timeline at the bottom shows versions 1.2.2.0 and 1.2.3.0.](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/724b890d63e87770de78ae7ab3b4c10f3ec4adf4/Media/Module%204/discovering%20and%20defining%20the%20backlog.png)
  *Image Credit: Blackboard PISG Agile and Scrum Training 2018*

* **Definition of Done (DoD) Review:**  
  Stories are updated or clarified to ensure shared understanding of what “done” looks like for each task.

**Procurement Alignment:**

* The COR attends as an observer to understand planned scope and complexity.

* COR and PO capture this discussion as part of performance planning.

* Helps tie delivery expectations to documented observations for **QASP** and **past performance** tracking.

* Surfaces early signals of risks that might require CO attention before the sprint begins.

### In-Class Activity Preview: Who Does What? Agile Role Round Robin

Agile delivery requires close coordination between federal and vendor roles but also clear responsibility.

In an upcoming live session,  you will complete the Agile Role Round Robin activity. In this interactive activity, you'll explore common delivery scenarios from the perspective of roles like the CO, COR, PO, and vendor team members. Together, you’ll identify decision points, clarify responsibilities, and surface where alignment matters most.

This activity will reinforce key concepts from the *Managing Digital Service Delivery* lesson and help you apply them in a realistic, role-based context.
