# Module 4 Sprint 3

## Contract Kickoff

Now that the contract has been awarded, team is assembled, and success has been agreed on, it’s time to shift our focus to post-award administration and contract kickoff. Even though a vendor has been selected—whether or not detailed discussions have already occurred in the solicitation process—there’s still critical information that must be shared and aligned between the government and the vendor team before work can truly begin.

Kickoff meetings are especially important in digital service procurements. They help establish the right working relationships, clarify expectations, surface and address assumptions, and formally initiate delivery. But before we dive into specific kickoff practices, it’s important to explore some digital service–specific dynamics that can shape the first few months of a project.

Here is a high level overview of what is covered in this section: 

* **Expect and Plan for Early Slowdowns:** Agile teams need time to calibrate. Early sprints are about learning and adjusting, not immediate delivery.  
* **Leverage Sprint 0 Effectively:** Use this phase to address all onboarding and setup issues, reducing risk for later sprints.  
* **Separate Contractual and Technical Discussions:** Hold distinct kickoff meetings for contract administration and technical execution to ensure clarity and alignment.  
* **Prioritize Communication and Documentation:** Regular check-ins, transparent metrics, and clear escalation paths are essential for managing agile and cloud contracts.  
* **Cloud Contracts:** Emphasize Security, Data, and Cost Controls: Cloud contracts require special attention to security compliance, data governance, and budget monitoring—more so than traditional IT contracts.


## Iterative Development Baseline: What to Expect in the First Months

Agile delivery doesn’t reach peak velocity from day one. Early stages of a project involve baselining—the essential period where the team defines its rhythm, adapts to the environment, establishes shared understanding, and iterates toward more efficient delivery—typically spanning 3–6 months.

It is possible, however, to achieve hyper productivity in the baselining period as long as everyone is aligned to that outcome. Even in industry, there are challenges with setting the right velocities, but the ultimate outcome has shown that the best Scrum teams average 750% gains over waterfall teams with higher customer satisfaction and better quality delivery[^1].

Agile development is rooted in complex adaptive systems theory. Rather than being a strict methodology or step-by-step process, Scrum is a lightweight framework that applies a set of simple, structured constraints. These constraints create the conditions for a team to self-organize and, over time, evolve into a highly productive unit. These constraints are either specified in the contract, or need to be developed as a team works together. One challenge aspect of team-based administration is that multiple teams will have different processes and constraints that apply only to them. 

During the baseline period \- it is possible to identify the common constraints between teams to administer scaled iterative development, so administration of these contracts should take that into consideration. 

### Why the early months often feel slower

* **Team dynamics:** Even if the vendor team has worked together before, they’re entering a new context—new Product Owner, agency processes, tools, and stakeholders. These changes require time to adjust.

* **Velocity calibration:** Teams use estimation techniques (like story points) to forecast delivery. Initial estimates are rough and only gain accuracy after several sprints, as shared understanding improves

* **Environment ramp-up:** Familiarizing with agency-specific workflows—internal rules, stakeholder coordination, approval processes—naturally slows delivery until the team stabilizes.

During this baselining phase, it’s best practice to chart steady improvement, not perfection from day one. Accept that early sprint quality levels may fall to the lower end of the minimum acceptable threshold. Over time, as communication and process familiarity grow, teams should consistently improve quality and throughput—ideally trending toward a predictable and high-performing cadence.

### Establishing baseline metrics

* **Velocity stabilization:** After the first sprint, calculate team velocity (e.g., story points per sprint) and use trends to forecast future delivery.

* **Quality measures:** Set initial expectations for acceptable work quality during early sprints, with a plan to elevate standards as the team matures. 

* **Performance documentation:** COR and PO should track sprint-level observations. Note patterns like repeated delays, unclear requirements, missed DoD, or skills gaps. These can indicate systemic issues needing adjustment.

**Risk signals that require action:**

* Consistent failure to improve between iterations due to the same blockers.

* Team roles or skill sets not functioning as intended.

* Deviations from contractual procedures or misunderstandings about contract scope.

These observations are crucial during the baselining period. Referring back to the contract—scope definitions, acceptance criteria, Definition of Done (DoD), and QASP—helps clarify expectations and guide corrective actions promptly.

## Understanding Sprint 0 in Agile Contracts

### What is Sprint 0?

Sprint 0 is a preparatory period at the very beginning of an agile contract—before formal delivery sprints begin. It's not a traditional sprint with a full backlog and deliverables, but rather a setup phase that lays the foundation for productive, iterative work. In federal digital service contracts, Sprint 0 is especially critical for navigating the logistical and administrative tasks that must be completed before teams can begin full delivery- and should be included in your product roadmap and contract timeframes. 

### Common Sprint 0 Activities:

* Onboarding vendor team members (clearances, accounts, credentials)

* Setting up Government-Furnished Equipment (GFE), access to systems, and tools

* Establishing shared working environments (e.g., collaboration tools, ticketing systems)

* Conducting kickoff meetings and contract orientation

* Defining the initial product vision and delivery roadmap

* Planning and scheduling agile ceremonies

* Aligning on Definition of Done (DoD), backlog structure, and performance documentation

* Running discovery or design sprints to inform backlog creation

### Why Sprint 0 Can Be Frustrating

Sprint 0 can last anywhere from a few days to several weeks, depending on agency-specific onboarding timelines and IT/security requirements. This delay can feel frustrating for both the vendor team and the government, especially when everyone is eager to start “hands-on-keyboard” work.

The key is to recognize that Sprint 0 is not lost time—it’s an opportunity to reduce delivery risk by setting up the environment, roles, and expectations correctly. Still, agile teams and COs should plan for how to hack the bureaucracy and reduce the drag of an extended Sprint 0\.

### Strategies to Mitigate Long Sprint 0s

1. **Plan for onboarding time in the acquisition strategy.**  
   Build realistic assumptions into the performance timeline about how long it typically takes to onboard contractors (clearances, credentials, GFE delivery).

2. **Identify parallel pre-access work.**  
    Determine what tasks the contractor can complete without full access. For example:

   * Research on user needs or regulations

   * Reviewing existing documentation under signed NDA’s

   * Building design concepts or wireframes

   * Setting up development environments or CI/CD pipelines in contractor space

3. **Negotiate “shadow access” arrangements.**  
    Some agencies may allow vendor staff to shadow government team members during early meetings or tool walkthroughs, even if they don’t yet have full access. Waivers or provisional access may also be available with sponsorship.

4. **Start with a discovery sprint.**  
    If delivery is delayed, start with a discovery or research sprint to clarify user needs, stakeholder landscape, and technical constraints. This can feed backlog creation while access is pending.

5. **Use contractor-hosted environments.**  
    If appropriate, allow the vendor to start building in their own secure environment with the understanding that code, artifacts, or designs will be transitioned to a government-approved environment once approvals are granted.

### Key Takeaway

Sprint 0 is a setup phase—not a slowdown. When strategically planned and managed, it creates the foundation for agile success by ensuring the right people, tools, access, and expectations are in place. Recognizing and planning for this period—while identifying opportunities to move forward in parallel—helps avoid frustration and positions the team for a faster, smoother start.

It's time to check your understanding.

## Ready to Launch: Contractual and Technical Kickoffs

Now we arrive at the kickoff phase—one of the most important points in a digital service contract. In practice, you will probably encounter two types of kickoff meetings, each serving a different but equally essential purpose:

1. **The Contract Kickoff**

2. **The Technical Kickoff**

This two-part approach aligns with the agile best practice of separating contractual structure from technical execution. While they are closely connected, each kickoff addresses a different set of decisions, led by different roles. These can be done at the same time or after some of the contractual onboarding activities have been completed. 

### The Contract Kickoff

The contract kickoff focuses on the business and contractual framework that governs the project. This is typically co-led by the Contracting Officer (CO) and the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR). The vendor team will provide an overview of their solution, and all parties review shared responsibilities and success criteria.

**Topics usually covered include:**

* Scope of the awarded contract and any constraints

* Proposed methods or processes the contractor will use

* Staffing approach and onboarding timelines

* Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) expectations

* Contract success metrics and reporting rhythms

* Escalation procedures and performance management structures

* Invoicing and funding checkpoints  
* Assumptions and clarifications not addressed in the solicitation process

The goal of the contract kickoff is to ensure that all parties have a shared understanding of the formal obligations, timelines, and administrative expectations outlined in the awarded contract.

### The Technical Kickoff

The technical kickoff shifts focus from contract mechanics to the day-to-day execution of agile delivery. This session is typically co-led by the Product Owner (PO) and vendor Technical Lead/SCRUM Master with support from the COR and vendor delivery team.

**Topics typically include:**

* Agreement on the Definition of Done for user stories

* Sprint schedule and cadence (planning, demos, retrospectives)

* Iteration tracking tools (e.g., Jira, Trello, GitHub Projects)

* Product backlog structure and prioritization approach

* Team roles and communication protocols

* Metrics to be tracked during each iteration (e.g., velocity, throughput, quality)

The technical kickoff is the time to align on how the team will collaboratively deliver working software, how work will be accepted, and how progress will be measured sprint by sprint.

### Key Differences – and Shared Needs

| Aspect | Contract Kickoff | Technical Kickoff |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Led by | CO & COR | Product Owner (with COR support) |
| Focus | Contract terms, staffing, QASP | Agile execution, team rhythm, tools |
| Success Metric Framework | Contract success criteria, QASP | Sprint-level DoD and delivery goals |
| Output | Aligned contractual expectations | Shared delivery plan and rhythm |

Regardless of which kickoff you’re leading or supporting, success depends on clarity and collaboration. Both meetings should:

* Establish a common language across government and vendor teams

* Define clear roles and responsibilities for decision-making

* Set communication norms (e.g., regular check-ins, asynchronous updates)

* Create clear escalation pathways for issues and risks

## Key Responsibilities in Administering Cloud Provisioning Contracts

Cloud provisioning in the federal government context differs significantly from the commercial world—not just in who manages the services, but in how responsibility, compliance, security, and ownership are defined. While commercial cloud buyers often rely on fully managed services and vendor-led automation, federal agencies must retain direct control over critical functions like data ownership, security posture, identity management, and cost governance. This creates a unique contract administration landscape where government teams—not just the vendor—must actively manage aspects of the cloud environment.

In this lesson, we’ll explore what it means for the government to be in the driver’s seat of a cloud contract. Whether the agency is managing a private cloud environment, provisioning access for multiple teams, or overseeing a hybrid architecture with shared vendor responsibilities, the contracting team plays a central role in ensuring security, cost efficiency, and contractual compliance.

### 1\. Security Compliance & Authorization

Cloud contractors must meet federal security mandates—like FedRAMP and FISMA:

At kickoff, the COR and CO should:

* Verify what level of cloud services are authorized, and what the ATO/FEDRAMP status is (e.g., FedRAMP Moderate or higher)

* Confirm incident response procedures align with agency policy and include SLAs for breach reporting

* Re-confirm data is geographically stored per contract requirements (e.g., U.S.-only hosting)

### 2\. Data Ownership & Governance

Agencies must retain control of their data even when hosted in the cloud. Best practices include:

* Clear contract clauses affirming government ownership of PII/PHI and outlining deletion or export rights

* Confirm policies for system snapshots, backups, and offboarding are documented

* Defined roles for encrypting data, with responsibility split between the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and agency depending on service type (IaaS vs SaaS)

The CO and COR should confirm:

* Ownership and access rights are clearly documented

* Encryption and key-escrow responsibilities are understood and assigned

* Contract clearly states how and when data must be destroyed or transferred

### 3\. User Provisioning & Access Management

Contractors often manage day-to-day operational roles: creating users, assigning roles, and updating permissions. Responsibilities include:

* Enforcing least privilege through Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and multi-factor authentication (MFA)

* Coordinating with agency IAM system and ensuring integration with SIEM, HR, and compliance systems

* Providing user audit logs and regular access reviews

CO/COR should ensure:

* A documented provisioning process exists with timelines and role clarity

* Agreements address management of temporary or deprovisioned accounts, and there is a process to watch for  “zombie” resources—instances spun up but never shut down

### 4\. Cloud Resource & Cost Governance

Cloud environments require constant monitoring and governance:

* Tools like AWS CloudWatch, Azure Cost Management, and CloudTamer enable usage oversight

* Contractors should report consumption thresholds (e.g., 50% and 75%) for budget tracking

CO/COR should confirm:

* SLAs include cost/usage reporting cadence and access to monitoring dashboards

* There are automated alerts for budget overrun or unused resources

### 5\. Maintenance, Incident Response & Forensics

Cloud contractors must be ready to:

* Detect and respond to incidents rapidly, meeting government-defined incident recovery timelines

* Cooperate with forensic investigations, preserving logs and evidence per contract terms

CO/COR should ensure:

* Incident thresholds, escalation paths, and forensic access are clearly defined

* CSP access for government and external auditors is granted

### 6\. Breach Procedures

Cloud contractors must be ready to:

* Distinguish "security incident" (any suspected unauthorized access) from a confirmed “data breach” (unauthorized disclosure of personal data).

* Establish a breach escalation response pathway or SOP (the contractor must phone the CO within 24 hours or sooner, etc), including what is pre-authorized for a “kill switch” on services to stop further damage.

* The contractor must cooperate with investigation requests, execute remedial action, and document all responses and lessons learned.

CO/COR should:

* Be aware of the breach liability cap, or establish one, which is often proportional to expected breach costs (e.g.,based on per-record damage studies)

* During contract performance, organize “tabletop exercises” to test the procedures with real world potential situations (similar to disaster recovery exercises)

## Sample CO/COR Oversight Checklist

| Oversight Area | What to Check |
| ----- | ----- |
| Security & Compliance | FedRAMP authorizations, clause implementation, incident plans |
| Data Governance | Ownership clauses, encryption, data export/destruction rights |
| Identity & Access Management | IAM integration, RBAC/MFA, ridealong and audit logging |
| Cost Monitoring | Budget thresholds, consumption reporting, unused resource reclamation |
| Cloud Resource Ops | Virtual Machine (VM) lifecycle, patching, backups, and capacity planning |
| Incident & Forensics | Time-to-respond metrics, log retention, agency forensic access |
| Breach Response | Breach escalation pathways (SOPs) are in place,  |

Even if the cloud solution isn’t a traditional application, the contract administration requirements are extensive. COs and CORs must treat cloud provisioning contracts with the same rigor as mission-critical software delivery. Strong governance, clarity on security/data requirements, cost controls, and access management are essential—and they all depend on clear communication and oversight between the agency and the cloud contractor.
