## Exit Strategy: The Digital Identity Crisis at FedConnect

_A Branching Scenario for Digital Acquisition Professionals_

---

### Introduction

> Sarah Martinez, a Contracting Officer at FBDS, faces a pivotal decision on the struggling FedConnect program. One vendor‚ÄîCloudTech‚Äîhas become a major risk to system performance. You‚Äôll step into Sarah‚Äôs role and make critical decisions about vendor management, integration, and strategy.

---

### Module 1: The Decision Point

You‚Äôve reviewed performance reports, technical analyses, and integration test results. CloudTech‚Äôs authentication service, while acceptable in isolation, is creating cascading failures in the integrated system. Your Director needs recommendations. What do you do?

#### What‚Äôs your decision?

1. [Terminate CloudTech for default](#module-2-terminate)
2. [Accept CloudTech‚Äôs remediation plan](#module-3-remediate)
3. [Restructure the system under a single prime contractor](#module-4-prime)

---

## Module 2: Terminate CloudTech for Default {#module-2-terminate}

You decide to terminate CloudTech‚Äôs contract.

### Immediate considerations:

- You must plan to procure a replacement vendor.
- Other modules may require interface changes.
- System integration risks could delay implementation by 6‚Äì9 months.

#### How will you proceed?

1. [Develop a detailed integration and transition plan](#module-5-transition-plan)
2. [Conduct stakeholder outreach and legal review](#module-6-outreach)
3. [Reconsider: return to main decision](#module-1)

---

## Module 3: Accept Remediation Plan {#module-3-remediate}

You agree to CloudTech‚Äôs proposal‚Äîwith conditions.

### Remediation requirements:

- Enhanced integration testing and monitoring
- Strict timeline and milestone-based payments
- Weekly joint vendor reviews

#### What will you prioritize?

1. [Contract modifications across vendors to ensure collaboration](#module-7-modify-contracts)
2. [Expanded monitoring and accountability measures](#module-8-monitoring)
3. [Reconsider: return to main decision](#module-1)

---

## Module 4: Move to Prime Contractor Model {#module-4-prime}

You decide to abandon the modular contracting approach.

### Outcomes:

- Simpler accountability
- Loss of modular contracting innovation
- Additional costs to rebid all modules under a prime

#### What‚Äôs your focus?

1. [Start market research for a systems integrator](#module-9-integrator)
2. [Communicate and terminate existing vendor contracts](#module-10-terminate-others)
3. [Reconsider: return to main decision](#module-1)

---

## Module 5: Transition Plan for Replacement Vendor {#module-5-transition-plan}

You begin developing a transition plan with these elements:

- Maintain CloudTech during transition
- Coordinate with SecureID, DataFlow, UX Partners, and MetricsTech
- Require integration testing from the new vendor pre-award

üéØ **Reflection**  
- How will you keep momentum while managing risk?
- What roles should other vendors play in transition planning?

---

## Module 6: Stakeholder Outreach and Legal Review {#module-6-outreach}

You engage key stakeholders:

- Legal prepares the default justification package
- Technical staff help define replacement integration needs
- Agency leadership prepares external communications

‚úÖ **Activity**  
Draft a 2-3 sentence rationale for termination to share with stakeholders.

---

## Module 7: Modify Existing Vendor Contracts {#module-7-modify-contracts}

You initiate discussions with other vendors to support enhanced integration.

### Potential changes:

- Update API specs and testing responsibilities
- Modify timelines and payment schedules
- Increase coordination points

üìå **Question for learners**  
What risks arise when modifying contracts for work outside original scope?

---

## Module 8: Expand Monitoring and Accountability {#module-8-monitoring}

You add new terms to CloudTech‚Äôs contract:

- Shared dashboards for performance metrics
- Root cause analysis for every major failure
- Withhold 10% of remaining funds until stability proves out

üß† **Reflection**  
When does increased monitoring become micromanagement?

---

## Module 9: Begin Market Research for Systems Integrator {#module-9-integrator}

You begin drafting an RFQ for a systems integrator to own the end-to-end system.

- Solicit feedback from program office, vendors, and users
- Consider hybrid structure that preserves some modularity

üì£ **Prompt for discussion**  
What trade-offs are involved in consolidating to a prime?

---

## Module 10: Terminate Other Vendors {#module-10-terminate-others}

You prepare termination notices for the four other vendors.

‚ö†Ô∏è This triggers:

- Exit negotiations
- Risk of reputational damage
- Internal resistance to abandoning modularity

‚öñÔ∏è **Prompt for learners**  
What arguments would you use to justify this decision to Congress or OMB?

---

### Final Reflection

No matter the path, Sarah‚Äôs decision reveals the real-world complexity of digital service acquisition. Modular contracting offers flexibility‚Äîbut also demands integration, documentation, and cross-vendor coordination. Every choice has trade-offs.

üó£Ô∏è **Group Activity (Optional)**  
Split into small groups. Each group selects a different decision path. Compare the short- and long-term risks and benefits.
