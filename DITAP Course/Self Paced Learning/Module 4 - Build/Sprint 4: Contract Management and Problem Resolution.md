## Optional Activity: Federal IT Acquisition, Management, and Software Engineering Practices

### Introduction

Throughout this iteration, you have been studying modern software engineering best practices including DevOps, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), DevSecOps, and AI-powered automation. These practices have revolutionized how successful organizations develop and deploy technology solutions. This activity examines real, federal IT challenges from [GAO's 2025 High Risk List](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-107743) to help you apply these modern practices to government acquisition scenarios.

### The Persistent Federal IT Challenge

Since this area was first designated high-risk in 2015, the federal government has struggled to effectively harness modern technology despite massive investments. The scale of this challenge is staggering: federal agencies invest over $100 billion annually in IT, yet much of this spending goes toward maintaining aging legacy systems rather than implementing innovative solutions.

The result is a significant increase in technical debt and expensive maintenance contracts to keep systems near or at their end-of-life to continue functioning.

The depth of the problem becomes clear when examining GAO's track record of recommendations. Since 2010, GAO has made 1,881 recommendations to federal agencies aimed at improving IT management. As of January 2025, 463 of these recommendations remain unimplemented, suggesting systemic resistance to change within government IT operations. GAO has identified three challenges that underlie these persistent problems: **strengthening oversight and management of IT portfolios, implementing mature IT acquisition and development practices, and building federal IT capacity and capabilities.**

This ongoing struggle stands in stark contrast to the rapid evolution of technology in the private sector, where organizations have embraced DevOps methodologies, AI-powered automation, and cloud-native architectures to achieve unprecedented speed and reliability in software delivery. The federal government's inability to keep pace with these developments has real consequences for the millions of Americans who depend on government services.

## Case Study: The FAFSA System Modernization

The Department of Education's attempt to modernize the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) system provides a revealing case study of how well-intentioned federal IT initiatives can go dramatically wrong despite having clear mandates, substantial funding, and urgent needs for improvement.

In March 2022, the Department awarded a $121.7 million contract to General Dynamics Information Technology to modernize the FAFSA Processing System. The timeline seemed reasonable, with an initial target launch of October 2023 and a legal deadline of January 1, 2024\. However, the project quickly encountered the types of problems that have become endemic in federal IT acquisitions.

Development issues emerged within months of the contract award. Twenty-five critical milestones for contract requirements were pushed back by months, signaling early trouble with project management and execution. More concerning, several key requirements remained unmet even when the system was forced to launch. As the October 2023 deadline approached, it became clear that the ambitious timeline was unrealistic, and the launch was delayed to the legal deadline of January 1, 2024\.

When the new FAFSA system finally launched in early 2024, it immediately encountered serious problems. The Department of Education identified more than 40 separate technical issues with the initial rollout, including fundamental problems that prevented students from starting or completing their applications. The direct IRS data integration, which was supposed to be a marquee feature of the new system, failed for approximately 20 percent of applications, requiring extensive reprocessing. Students whose parents lacked Social Security numbers faced particularly severe problems, with some unable to complete applications for months.

The operational impact was devastating. Colleges and universities, which generally begin sending financial aid awards to students in January, were forced to delay this crucial process. Many institutions pushed back enrollment deadlines to give students more time to understand their financial aid packages. Application completion rates among high school seniors dropped, raising concerns about potential enrollment declines. The Department faced what observers described as a "crisis of credibility" with higher education institutions that had been forced to repeatedly adjust their processes to accommodate the system's failures.

Recognizing the severity of the situation, the Department implemented emergency recovery measures. They brought in external expertise by hiring Jeremy Singer, the longtime president of the College Board, as "FAFSA executive advisor," and Jeff Olson as technical advisor. The Department allocated $50 million in federal funding to nonprofit organizations to provide additional support to institutions struggling with the new system. They also suspended routine program reviews and implemented more transparent communication practices, acknowledging that defensiveness about the problems only exacerbated the situation.

### Modern Context and Lessons

The FAFSA case study illustrates several critical lessons about federal IT acquisition in the modern era. First, it demonstrates how traditional government contracting approaches often fail to incorporate the iterative, user-centered design principles that have become standard in successful technology development. The project's "big bang" approach, attempting to deploy a completely new system all at once, contradicts modern DevOps practices that emphasize incremental delivery and continuous feedback (i.e., modular contracting).

The case also highlights the importance of robust testing and quality assurance processes. Modern CI/CD practices would have caught many of the system's defects before they reached production, but the Department skipped planned testing phases to meet launch deadlines. This decision reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how to strike a balance between speed and quality in software delivery.

Ultimately, the FAFSA experience highlights the challenges that federal agencies encounter in developing and sustaining technical capacity. The reliance on external contractors for critical system development, combined with limited internal expertise to provide adequate oversight, created conditions where problems could persist undetected until launch.

The broader context of federal IT challenges in 2025 includes several significant trends that agencies must navigate. The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning into government operations is accelerating, with agencies establishing Chief AI Officers and implementing AI-powered automation tools.

DevSecOps practices are becoming increasingly essential as cybersecurity threats evolve, with industry predictions suggesting that organizations implementing these practices will reduce vulnerabilities by 50% by 2026\. Meanwhile, recent executive orders have begun modernizing defense acquisitions and overhauling the Federal Acquisition Regulation to encourage more streamlined engagement with commercial technology providers.

## Activity Instructions

Using your knowledge of modern software engineering practices and the context provided above, could you look over the FAFSA case study or select another current federal IT challenge from GAO's 2025 High Risk List?

Your analysis should show that you understand how contemporary DevOps, CI/CD, and digital transformation practices could address systemic issues that plague federal IT acquisitions.

### Question 1: 

Modernization Strategy Given GAO's finding that 463 IT acquisition recommendations remain unimplemented across the federal government, what specific modern DevOps and CI/CD practices would you implement to address the three significant federal IT challenges identified, strengthening IT portfolio oversight, implementing mature acquisition practices, and building federal IT capacity?

*Learning Note: In developing your response, consider how AI-powered automation could improve project management and oversight, what role DevSecOps practices would play in reducing security vulnerabilities, how progressive delivery methods could minimize deployment risks, and what modern workforce development approaches are needed to build sustainable technical capacity within government.*

### Question 2: 

Strategic Leadership Approach With federal agencies spending over $100 billion annually on IT, mostly on legacy system maintenance rather than innovation, how would you design a comprehensive digital transformation strategy that incorporates current best practices while addressing the unique procurement and organizational challenges identified in the case study?

*Learning Note: Your response should address the integration of modern CI/CD pipelines with federal acquisition processes, strategies for balancing innovation with security and compliance requirements, approaches for building internal technical capacity versus continuing to depend on contractors, and change management strategies for large-scale government transformation initiatives.*

### Question 3: 

Contemporary Policy Analysis The 2024 State of CI/CD Report identified "a concerning trend where a significant portion of organizations are lagging in performance despite widespread adoption of DevOps practices." How does this finding apply to federal IT transformation efforts? What are the implications for government agencies attempting to modernize their technology capabilities?

*Learning Note: Consider why technical adoption alone doesn't guarantee success, the role of organizational culture and change management in digital transformation, how federal constraints such as regulatory requirements, budget cycles, and political pressures impact implementation, and lessons that can be drawn from both successful and failed government digital initiatives.*
