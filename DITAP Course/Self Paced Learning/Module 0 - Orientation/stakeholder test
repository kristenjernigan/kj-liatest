# **Stakeholder Interests Template**

Use this template once you have mapped who your stakeholders are at each stage in the acquisition lifecycle. Complete the chart below to help you better understand and manage your stakeholders’ interests. This template will help you to plan who you need to connect with as well as likely risks that may arise when partnering with stakeholders. 

| Understanding My Stakeholder Interests |  |  |  |
| ----- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Who are my stakeholders? Include a brief description of their function, if helpful. *Examples include: end user, legal, budget, SBE, and external councils/oversight.* | What may be the stakeholder’s interests or concerns? List all that apply. *Consider technical, interpersonal, and program/project management interests.*  | What will the stakeholder find challenging? List all that apply.  *Again, consider technical, interpersonal, and program/project management interests.*  | What is the stakeholder’s likely contribution to digital services acquisition?  |
| Stakeholder 1:  |  |  |  |
| Stakeholder 2:   |  |  |  |
| Stakeholder 3:  |  |  |  |
| Stakeholder 4:  |  |  |  |
| Stakeholder 5:   |  |  |  |
| Now, review your stakeholder interests and challenges to prioritize those that have the greatest likelihood of impacting digital services acquisition at your agency.  You may use either colored pens to circle the interests/challenges or the symbols listed below. This will help you to organize your interests and challenges into: Greatest potential assets to the project (use an \+).  Greatest potential risks to the project (use an \-).  Greatest potential challenges/roadblocks (use an \*).  |  |  |  |
