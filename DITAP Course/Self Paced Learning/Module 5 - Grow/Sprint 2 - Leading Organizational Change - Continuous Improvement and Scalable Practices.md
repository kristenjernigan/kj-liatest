## Staying Current and Driving Change: Your Role in Continuous Improvement

### Why Continuous Learning Matters in Federal Acquisition

Technology and policy in the federal space are evolving faster than ever. From emerging tools like artificial intelligence to policy shifts that emphasize modernization, acquisition professionals must stay ahead of change, not react to it.

In your role, you’re not just supporting procurement, you’re enabling agency success. Your ability to adapt, learn, and apply new knowledge directly impacts how effectively your agency meets its goals.

But keeping up doesn’t just happen. It takes intention. Continuous learning isn’t a one-time event \- it’s a mindset and a habit. By staying curious, seeking out new tools and trends, and learning from each acquisition you manage, you build resilience and stay relevant in a fast-changing environment.

Continuous learning also strengthens your ability to lead change. Whether you're exploring new contracting strategies, testing out new digital tools, or mentoring others, your growth can create a ripple effect across your team and agency.

In today’s environment, continuous learning isn’t optional; it’s a core part of being an effective, future-ready acquisition professional.

By the end of this module, you will be able to assess your strengths and change style to develop a personal plan for contributing to and promoting change within your agency and the broader government community.

## Staying Current with Emerging Tech and Trends

Technology is reshaping the way the federal government delivers services, and acquisition plays a central role in making it happen. From artificial intelligence and cybersecurity to automation and cloud-native solutions, emerging technologies are influencing everything from how agencies define requirements to how vendors respond.

### Why It Matters

Emerging tech isn’t just for IT teams. Staying informed about technology trends empowers you to:

* Engage in more meaningful conversations with program and technical staff  
* Structure solicitations that reflect modern capabilities  
* Anticipate how industry might respond to your requirements  
* Support mission delivery with smarter, more adaptive contracts

### Tech in Action: Generative AI and Federal Acquisition

Take **generative AI** as an example. It has already begun influencing how acquisition professionals:

* Conduct **market research** by analyzing vendor data more efficiently  
* Draft or refine **performance work statements** using AI-assisted language tools  
* Create **procurement templates** that reflect emerging best practices

This type of fast-moving innovation requires curiosity and a commitment to staying informed, even when formal guidance is still evolving.

### Where to Watch for Tech Trends

You don’t need to be a technologist to stay tech-aware. Here are trusted sources where you can spot trends relevant to acquisition:

* **FedScoop** – News and updates on federal IT and innovation  
* **ACT-IAC** – Public-private partnership events and reports on federal tech  
* **TechFAR Hub** – Guidance and examples of applying tech in acquisition  
* **Agency Innovation Labs** – Many agencies (e.g., DHS, HHS) have internal labs testing new tools and methods  
* **US Digital Service (USDS)** – Insight into user-centered, tech-forward project delivery

### Tracking and Engaging with Tech Influencers

Staying current also means learning from the people shaping the conversation. You can:

* **Follow thought leaders** on platforms like LinkedIn or tune in to interviews on Federal News Network

* **Join professional organizations** like:  
  * **NCMA** – National Contract Management Association  
  * **Digital Services Coalition** – A network of vendors focused on digital government  
  * **Technologists for the Public Good** \- nonprofit professional association connecting technologists from across government and industry to modernize public-sector services

* **Subscribe to curated content** that filters the noise and brings key updates to your inbox:  
  * Federal News Network newsletters  
  * FAI (Federal Acquisition Institute) Acquisition Today newsletter

### Making It a Habit

It’s easy to fall behind if learning isn’t part of your routine. Here are small but effective ways to stay on top of change:

* **Set a monthly “tech check” reminder** to scan newsletters or skim recent articles  
  **Join quarterly briefings or virtual roundtables** offered by GSA, ACT-IAC, or your agency’s digital team  
* **Add tech trend reviews** to after-action discussions or procurement retrospectives  
* **Block time during less busy weeks** for self-guided learning or event replays

### Final Thoughts

You don’t need to be an expert in AI, cybersecurity, or cloud architecture. But understanding the direction technology is heading and how it’s shaping your acquisition environment makes you a more strategic, forward-thinking contracting professional.

Staying current isn’t about keeping up with every trend, it’s about staying connected enough to ask smart questions, spot opportunities, and support your agency’s evolving needs.

## Self-Reflection: Your Tech Awareness Habits (Optional)

Take a few minutes to reflect on the following questions. You can jot down your responses or simply pause to think them through:

1. **How do I currently stay informed about changes in technology or acquisition practices?**  *(e.g., newsletters, team discussions, events, personal reading)*  
2. **What challenges have I faced in keeping up with emerging trends?**  
    *(e.g., time constraints, information overload, lack of relevance)*  
3. **What’s one small habit I could start to stay more current?**  
    *(e.g., setting a monthly “tech check” reminder, following a specific newsletter or expert)*  
4. **Who in my agency or network is already good at this? Could I learn from or connect with them?**
