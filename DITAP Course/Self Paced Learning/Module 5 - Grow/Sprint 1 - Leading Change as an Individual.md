# Module 5 Sprint 1 

## Introduction: Leading Change

In today’s fast-moving government environment, you are uniquely positioned to lead and influence positive change, from refining everyday procurement practices to scaling innovations across agencies. This module is designed to help you understand your personal role in driving change, strengthen your influence and collaboration skills, and develop strategies for continuous improvement and organizational growth.

You’ll move through two focused sprints:

* **Sprint 1: Leading Change as an Individual**  
   Learn how to be an effective change agent by identifying your personal influence strategies, building networks, and engaging stakeholders to support new ideas and approaches.

* **Sprint 2: Leading Organizational Change – Continuous Improvement and Scalable Practices**  
   Explore strategies for staying current with emerging technologies, applying lessons learned from each procurement, and scaling what works across your agency and the broader acquisition community.

Through both sprints, you’ll apply techniques to **create a culture of innovation within your sphere of influence**—one that empowers you and those around you to lead change and guide customers toward the best solutions.
