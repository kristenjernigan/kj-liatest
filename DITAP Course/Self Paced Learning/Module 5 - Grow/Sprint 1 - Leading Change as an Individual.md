# Module 5 Sprint 1 

## Introduction: Leading Change

In today’s fast-moving government environment, you are uniquely positioned to lead and influence positive change, from refining everyday procurement practices to scaling innovations across agencies. This module is designed to help you understand your personal role in driving change, strengthen your influence and collaboration skills, and develop strategies for continuous improvement and organizational growth.

You’ll move through two focused sprints:

* **Sprint 1: Leading Change as an Individual**  
   Learn how to be an effective change agent by identifying your personal influence strategies, building networks, and engaging stakeholders to support new ideas and approaches.

* **Sprint 2: Leading Organizational Change – Continuous Improvement and Scalable Practices**  
   Explore strategies for staying current with emerging technologies, applying lessons learned from each procurement, and scaling what works across your agency and the broader acquisition community.

Through both sprints, you’ll apply techniques to **create a culture of innovation within your sphere of influence**—one that empowers you and those around you to lead change and guide customers toward the best solutions.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Define what it means to be a change agent and identify your individual change style

* Apply strategies to influence and engage stakeholders effectively

* Build and leverage networks and coalitions to support change efforts

* Describe approaches for staying informed about emerging technologies and evolving practices

* Identify opportunities to scale successful practices across teams or organizations

* Develop a personal plan for contributing to and promoting change within your agency and beyond

* Apply techniques to foster a culture of innovation that enables effective leadership and customer engagement

## **Preparing for and Having an Influence Conversation** 

### Introduction 

You recently practiced influence conversations as a way to engage a variety of stakeholders.

As with most processes and initiatives, work gets accomplished in acquisition as much through networks, the quality and depth of relationships, and the willingness of employees to work productively with each other, as it does through formal authority and roles. 

As you lead change in digital services acquisition (and therefore change in your agency’s acquisition policies and practices), these networks, relationships, and employee commitments are assets you need. 

![An overhead shot of people sitting around a large white circular table, most holding smartphones or tablets.](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/9e11fd265cf81cfb6b797f6045e80a6f8f157447/Media/Module%205/influence%20conversation.png)

To meet the contracting needs of your digital services team, you'll be asking your agency to make changes in its procurement practices, how people work together, and the operating tempo of the acquisition lifecycle. 

In this module, you'll revisit how to prepare for an influence conversation by taking a second look at the following steps: 

![Aninfographic with four steps, each representing a step in an influence conversation. From top to bottom: 1. Identify the Need or Problem for the Influence Conversation. 2. Target the range of influencers who can satisfy the need or help solve the problem. 3. Select those with the greatest leverage. 4. Prepare for the conversation using the Ladder of Inference.](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/9e11fd265cf81cfb6b797f6045e80a6f8f157447/Media/Module%205/steps%20for%20influence%20conversation.png)

## Identify the Need or Problem

As you lead a digital services procurement, you'll likely need to accomplish out-of-the ordinary tasks. We’ve discussed how you may need to conduct nontraditional market research, engage with potential contractors at a deeper level, or develop a more iterative acquisition strategy. As you work on these unusual tasks, you'll likely encounter resistance or worse from people who oversee or are involved with the practice you are changing, but who function in roles you cannot control. 

You can anticipate this resistance by understanding what you are working to change and what roles in the process it might affect.   

![A man in a dark suit and blue shirt with a tie sits at a round table, looking down thoughtfully while writing on a piece of paper. ](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/9e11fd265cf81cfb6b797f6045e80a6f8f157447/Media/Module%205/man%20thinking.png)

Think of a particular problem, opportunity, or need you have as a digital services acquisition leader. The following are representative examples of challenges you may face in your agencies and live digital assignments: 

* Accelerating cycle time in a particular part of the acquisition lifecycle or procurement process to meet the needs of your Product Owner and particular backlog requirements   
* Gaining relief from a policy that requires an exhaustive and lengthy review process by a Contract Review Board or other oversight group every time the agency considers a new type of procurement or one that's not common practice in your agency   
* Addressing a higher intensity role and increased resource commitments you need CORs and program representatives to play in your digital services procurement   
* Solving the issue of receiving incremental funding across fiscal years instead of one allocation in a given fiscal year or a larger, multi-year program   
* Creating different procurement performance **metrics** and measures based on iteration/release outcomes instead of more standard procurement performance outputs


Have you experienced any of these? 

Take a moment to share a challenge of your own, or feel free to adapt one of the examples above. Post your challenge in the discussion section below, and how you overcame these challenges. 

### Discussion (optional)

As you think about this topic, consider the following:

* How can we align our procurement timelines with the rapid development cycles needed for digital products?  
* What specific policy constraints are causing the most significant bottlenecks in our digital acquisition process?  
* How can we better prepare and support our CORs and program representatives to succeed in digital service oversight roles?  
* What alternative funding mechanisms can we explore to support iterative development across fiscal boundaries?  
* How do we measure success in digital service acquisitions differently from traditional procurement?  
* Who are the key stakeholders we need to educate about modern digital practices to gain their support?  
* How can we implement smaller, more frequent procurements rather than large, monolithic contracts?  
* What data do we need to collect to demonstrate the value and efficiency of our digital acquisition approach?  
* How might we create reusable procurement templates to accelerate future digital acquisitions?  
* What lessons can we learn from other agencies that have successfully modernized their acquisition practices?

## Target the Range of Influencers Who Can Satisfy the Need/Help Solve the Problem 

Based on the problem you have selected, identify the range of influencers who can help you address this problem. Refer back to the Stakeholder Analysis Activity to help you get started. In some cases, you may need to reach out to your own network and mentors for help in identifying the influencers who you have some direct or indirect power over. 

![A group of business people stand on a network of interconnected circles, simulating a social or professional network](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/9e11fd265cf81cfb6b797f6045e80a6f8f157447/Media/Module%205/target%20range%20of%20influencers.png)

The following table lists some example challenges you may encounter, along with the potential range of influencers affected by that issue or challenge. These influencers have the potential to either improve your ability to overcome the challenge or prevent you from accomplishing what you need. 

| Potential Issue/Challenge | Potential Range of Influencers |
| :---- | :---- |
| Accelerating cycle time in the procurement process | Head Contracting Authority (HCA) or Procurement Division Lead Policy Office Lead or Representative Senior Contracting Officer Senior Contracting Officer Representative (COR) |
| Gaining relief from a policy that requires a lengthy review process | Senior Procurement Representative, Deputy, or SPE Office Representative Office of General Counsel or Representative Chief Management Officer, Deputy Secretary, or Designee HCA or Representatives Policy Office Lead Representative Acquisition Innovation Advocate |
| Addressing increased role and  resource commitments with  program representatives | Bureau or Office Directors or Designees Product Owner(s) Program Leaders CORs |
| Receiving incremental funding across fiscal years | Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Deputy or Designee HCA, Procurement Division Lead, or Designee SPE or Designee |
| Creating different/agile  procurement performance  measures | Policy Office Lead or Designee SPE, Deputy SPE or Designee Performance Improvement or Strategy Office CMO or Designee  |

Now think about the titles of the influencers in your chosen problem. Who could help, or hinder, your efforts? 

### Discussion (optional)

As you think about this topic, consider the following:

* Who are the formal decision-makers at each level of the organization for this digital initiative?  
* Which informal leaders have significant social capital regardless of their position?  
* Who controls resources (budget, personnel, technology) needed for this transformation?  
* Whose day-to-day work will be most directly impacted by these digital changes?  
* Which stakeholders have successfully championed similar initiatives in the past?  
* What are each influencer's primary goals, metrics, and priorities?  
* How can you frame the digital transformation in terms that resonate with each influencer's priorities?  
* Where is resistance most likely to emerge and why?  
* How do formal and informal communication channels operate in this organization?  
* Where do silos exist that might impede cross-functional collaboration?  
* How will this digital transformation affect existing power structures?

 

## Select those with the greatest leverage

After identifying the range of influencers, you need to narrow down your list and choose those with the greatest leverage or impact over your issue or challenge. You may need to turn to your adviser or mentor for assistance in this process.   

![A professional woman in a dark shirt gestures towards a complex network of interconnected circular profile pictures of individuals, appearing to touch one of the connections.

To help you determine who has the greatest leverage in your situation, answer the following questions: 

1. What's the source of the influence the other party has over your issue or challenge?   
2. What power do they have over the process, outcomes, resources, or supporting roles regarding your issue or challenge?   
3. How close or distant is your relationship with them – by function, position, hierarchy – or by some common, shared interest or experience?   
4. Who influences them? What's the web or network of other influencers who play reciprocal roles in this issue or challenge? What's your relationship with these  
   other influencers? What motivates them?  
5. How significant is their influence over your issue or challenge? Is it direct or indirect? 

### Discussion (optional)

Based on your answer to these questions, select the influencer who can most impact your issue or challenge, either negatively or positively. Share below and provide your reasons for why you chose this person. Again, use a title instead of a name. 

## Prepare for the Conversation Using the Ladder of Inference 

![Two businessmen, both wearing suits, are shaking hands and smiling](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/9e11fd265cf81cfb6b797f6045e80a6f8f157447/Media/Module%205/two%20men%20shaking%20hands.png)

Now that you have identified the person of greatest influence for your problem, it's time to plan your conversation with them.   
We each enter a new conversation or new environment with a set of preconceptions or biases. The Ladder of Inference is a tool to understand how we develop and take action on these biases and preconceptions. The Ladder works like this: 

1. At the bottom of the Ladder is observable data or phenomena in the real world.   
2. First rung up from the bottom, we select specific data to focus on.   
3. On the second rung, we interpret the data and create an explanation of what the data means.   
4. On the third rung, we develop theories and beliefs that explain our interpretation.   
5. Finally, we take action based on those theories and beliefs. 

![An image of a blue step ladder on the left, with an upward-pointing blue arrow next to it on the right. Along the arrow, five bullet points are listed from bottom to top, representing the steps of the Ladder of Inference: -Observable data or phenomena, -Focus on specific data, -Interpret the data and explain what it means, -Develop theories and beliefs, -Take action.](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/9e11fd265cf81cfb6b797f6045e80a6f8f157447/Media/Module%205/ladder%20of%20inference.png)

You can best prepare for your influence conversation by working to understand the potential Ladders of Inference you and your influencer may be using. 

Let’s look at an example problem:

You have a situation where you need to change the lengthy review process for a new type of contract. A Policy Office Representative is insisting that the lengthy review process needs to be followed. They've experienced procurements that failed because they were trying something new and did not have appropriate oversight. This experience created the interpretation that consistent and rigid oversight is needed in all cases. The Representative has developed a theory that the best way to prevent a similar occurrence is through a Contract Review Board (CRB) process. Therefore, they're insisting that your procurement go through the same process. 

To use the Ladder of Inference, think about how the influencer may arrive at these kinds of conclusions and how you may be able to walk the Ladder of Inference to resolve the issue. In the case of the Policy Office Representative, you may be able to engage them in solving the problem of what kind of oversight could satisfy the same concern without going through a formal CRB. 

To set the meeting with your influencer, reach out directly if you already know each other or are close enough in the organization that you know each other by your roles. If you are not familiar with each other, ask your mentor, adviser, or another contact for an introduction. Finally, you also have the option to reach out directly under the authority of your digital services acquisition role because your agency has committed to your digital services education. 

### Discussion (optional)

Analyze your problem using the Ladder of Inference. Share what each rung would cover and how you can use it to direct the conversation in the discussion below. 

As you think about this topic, consider the following:

* What specific procurement failures led to their conviction about rigid oversight?  
* Which elements of those failed procurements were most problematic?  
* Are there successful procurements with alternative review approaches we can examine?  
* What data might the Representative be filtering out when focusing only on failures?  
* How has the Representative connected "new procurement approaches" with "failure"?  
* What assumptions exist about the similarity between past failed procurements and our current situation?  
* What assumptions underlie the belief that the CRB process is the only effective oversight method?  
* Is there an assumption that all new procurement types carry the same risks?  
* How did the Representative conclude that consistent, rigid oversight is universally beneficial?  
* Has the belief that "innovation in procurement equals risk" become entrenched?

 

Once you have considered the above, consider some strategies to overcome these challenges:

* **Find Common Ground**: Acknowledge the importance of oversight while suggesting tailored approaches for different situations.  
* **Share Success Stories**: Provide examples of successful procurements that used streamlined review processes.  
* **Propose Alternative Oversight**: Develop a modified review process that addresses specific risks without the full CRB burden.  
* **Use Data**: Present metrics on time/resources spent on CRB versus outcomes achieved.  
* **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: Invite the Representative to help design an alternative process that addresses their concerns.  
* **Pilot Approach**: Suggest a limited test of a modified review process with specific success metrics.  
* **Risk-Based Assessment**: Propose a framework for matching review intensity to actual risk level of the procurement.  
* **Elevate Agency Goals**: Frame the discussion around how streamlined processes support broader agency mission and service delivery.  
* **Document Safeguards**: Create explicit documentation of how oversight will be maintained in the alternative approach.  
* **Feedback Loop**: Build in checkpoints and feedback mechanisms to demonstrate commitment to learning and improvement.

  

## Transitioning to the Conversation

The next online module will teach you how to survive a difficult conversation by identifying constructive approaches in a conversation, identifying useful tactics to react to problems, and recognizing common topics that can cause misalignment with acquisition strategies and Agile methodology.
