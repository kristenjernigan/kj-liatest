## Digital Services - The How

The rapid pace of change in the digital industry, shifting consumer expectations, and budget pressures of doing more with less drive the U.S. Government to adopt new approaches for designing, developing, and delivering digital services.  
  

Just as defining the digital services landscape can seem complex, so can trying to explain how they are developed. While there is no one-size-fits-all process for how digital services should be developed, there are contemporary practices that can help the government build more effective digital services. 

After this module, you will be able to:

- Identify strategies to help you identify user needs.
- Describe contemporary practices used to develop digital services.

### The Common Denominator

All digital projects should start with the end user. This simple principle is foundational to designing, developing, and delivering digital services. In fact, “Understand what people need” is the first play in the [U.S. Digital Service Playbook](https://playbook.usds.gov/), which you will explore as you progress through this module.

### Discussion: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly

- What commercial companies or government agencies do you know of that keep user needs at the forefront? How does this show? What steps do you think they took to get to where they are?
- What commercial companies or government agencies do you know of that didn’t prioritize user needs? What were the consequences?

### Strategies for Keeping Focused on the End User

Here are some strategies from [Play 1](https://playbook.usds.gov/#play1) of the U.S. Digital Services Playbook to help keep you focused on the user's needs. Note that this list is not all-inclusive. It is a starting point that you will build on throughout your learning journey.

__Do your research__

- Spend time with current and prospective users of the service.
- Do more than just interview; use qualitative and quantitative research methods to determine people’s goals, needs, and behaviors; be thoughtful about the time spent.
- Before the digital service is built, test prototypes on real people
- As the digital service is being built, regularly test it with potential users to ensure it meets people’s needs.

__Document and share your findings__

- Document the findings about user goals, needs, behaviors, and preferences.
- Share findings with the team and agency leadership.

__Prioritize development tasks based on user needs__

- Create a prioritized list of tasks the user is trying to accomplish, also known as user stories.

Next, let's examine a few techniques that can help you implement the strategies listed in Play 1. 


## Learn About Your Users’ Needs

Depending on the type of digital service being developed and the organization, you will hear about one or all of the following techniques for learning more about your users’ needs. Here, we present you with an overview of some of these techniques. As you progress in your learning journey, you will learn more about how to implement these techniques and when each is most appropriate.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

You might think you know what your end user needs. However, starting development without testing your hypotheses could create a big headache for you and end up wasting the American taxpayer’s money. Luckily there is a way to test your hypotheses. The MVP is a core component of [Lean Startup methodology](https://theleanstartup.com/principles) developed by Eric Ries. This method focuses on delivering the smallest product possible to test hypotheses about customer needs. This should be a light-weight product, something even as simple as a wireframe or PowerPoint that outlines functionality. It just needs to be big enough for you to test your hypotheses. This can be done by the acquisition professional, program office, or through a vendor. Once you have your MVP, you solicit feedback to test your assumptions, and then document and analyze your results. As a result of your analysis, you will need to choose whether to pivot or persevere. 

| Pivot | Persevere |
| ----- |--------|
| As a result of your analysis, you adapt your plan to reflect more accurately what you've found. |Your testing supports your hypotheses. What you validate turns into your product backlog. |

Read how the Department of Education developed a simple prototype made of cardboard and paper to test their ideas for a mobile-friendly college scorecard. They also took Play 1 to heart in other ways by talking directly to high school students and leveraging a variety of data to inform their development.

### A/B Testing

![Two different screens on a tablet, one marked A, one marked B](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/7d812a8b27abe4f39802dfd4ead5afcc8a7dff07/Media/Module%201/A-B%20Testing%202.jpg)

A/B testing is a method for developing and refining products. This method allows you to test ideas in real time. You can use this method to test even the smallest of components (e.g., layouts, wording, image, amount of text). With A/B testing, seemingly subjective decisions can now be driven by data.

### Personas

Personas are fictional characters that teams create to help understand their users. Personas are usually concise and visual, with a focus on goals and behaviors rather than tasks or job descriptions.

She needs help finding information online, easy to understand information, and financial support form the government to help pay her bills](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/a2235c7d6ed21dc35d232d8c76926494a570544c/Media/Module%201/USA.gov-Personas-March-2015%20Linda.jpg)

### Using Personas as an Anchor for Development

Imagine you’re remodeling your house. It’s up to you and your spouse to decide what’s most important to include in your remodel. But there can be lots of other opinions about what’s most important. Your builder tells you about some cool new features. Your brother tells you about the latest and greatest techniques for redoing bathrooms. Your neighbor shares what worked well for them. Before you know it, you and your spouse’s preferences can easily be lost. The same thing can (and likely will!) happen during digital service projects. You can use personas as an anchor for your development decisions. Priority should always go toward efforts that will best meet user needs.

Because your personas drive development decisions, it is important that you consider personas as living documents. User needs can evolve as technology evolves. Keep your users' needs in check by leveraging research, engaging them in dialogue, and involving them in the testing of your digital product or service.

### Journey Mapping

You can use journey mapping to explore users' feelings, questions, and needs as they interact with your organization and the service/product offered. Personas can also serve as a foundation for creating journey maps.

## Contemporary Practices in Developing Digital Services

Now that we’ve covered the common denominator of all digital services development, let’s explore contemporary practices outlined in the U.S. Digital Services Playbook. Take this section for what it is—a survey, not an exhaustive list, of current practices. Remember that keeping pace with current technologies takes a concerted effort. Consider this a starting point for building your digital service development know-how. 

As procurement professionals, you are critical in shaping how the government invests in digital services. Modern approaches like Agile, Human-Centered Design (HCD), and DevSecOps aren’t just buzzwords—they're proven strategies that lead to better outcomes. These methods help government teams and contractors adapt quickly to changing needs, deliver working features faster, and reduce costly rework. They also provide greater transparency into contractor performance, helping ensure taxpayer dollars are used efficiently and effectively. Understanding how these approaches work—and how to look for them in proposals—can help you support more informed acquisitions and more successful digital service projects.
