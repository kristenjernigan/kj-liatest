## Negotiating with Vendors

### Introduction

In traditional federal acquisitions, there’s a perception that opening negotiations during a solicitation:

* Adds unnecessary time  
* Increases the risk of protests  
* Doesn’t meaningfully improve outcomes

For digital services procurements, these assumptions are myths.

Digital service acquisitions are different — they rely on **communication, transparency, and collaboration** with vendors to deliver the best outcomes.

In digital procurements:

* **Negotiations** at the right time prevent misunderstandings and save time later.

* **Strategic discussions** build trust — crucial for high-risk, agile projects.

* **Early negotiations** can clear up incomplete information in proposals.

* You don’t have to negotiate with everyone — focus on top-ranked vendors to sharpen competition and speed up award.

Key benefits of early negotiations:

* Reduce protest risk by clarifying proposal gaps

* Correct misunderstandings before award

* Test vendor flexibility and responsiveness

* Improve technical outcomes by getting the best — not just “good enough” — proposals

In digital services procurements, negotiations are not an optional afterthought — they are a vital part of selecting the right partner.

### What are negotiations?  

The FAR defines **negotiations** as:

“Exchanges between the Government and offerors undertaken with the intent of allowing the offeror to revise its proposal.”

Negotiations differ from:

* **Clarifications** – Minor corrections or explanations; proposals are not revised  
* **Communications** – Used to establish a competitive range; proposals still not revised

Negotiations can be conducted in both sole source and competitive acquisitions. 

In **sole source** acquisitions, the FAR uses “negotiations.” In **competitive** ones, it uses “discussions.”

In this lesson, we will use the term “negotiations” to apply to both situations.

The primary purpose of the source selection process is to allow the Government to choose the offer that represents best value — to select the offer that best meets the Government’s needs at a fair and reasonable price. Contract negotiations are a way to maximize the ability to obtain best value. 

### Best Practices for Digital Service Procurements 

* **Negotiate Early, Especially at Down-Selects:** Use advisory notices as a structured opportunity to open meaningful, time-boxed negotiations.

* **Focus Negotiations on Top Candidates:** Don't waste time trying to negotiate with every vendor — invest effort where there's a real potential for improvement.

* **Treat Discussions as Mutual Vetting:** You're not just evaluating vendors — you’re letting vendors evaluate the government’s approach and constraints.

* **Resolve Misaligned Assumptions:** Address gaps and misunderstandings now. It's exponentially harder to fix after a contract award.

* **Prepare Vendors for Iterative/Agile Contracts:** Many vendors are still transitioning to truly iterative delivery. Discuss expectations for backlog ownership, minimum viable products (MVPs), and iterative releases.

### Negotiation Opportunities During Challenges

In today's digital services procurements, solicitations increasingly involve **multi-phase evaluations,** such as:

* And initial phase to review case studies, past performance, videos or other pass/fail methods.  
* Code challenges, live technical demonstrations, or interview-style oral presentations.  
* Moving forward with only the highest-rated vendors to the full documentation/ technical proposal stage. 

At advisory or other down-select points, negotiations can be included at multiple phases, and might make sense at the point of making selection determinations, especially if there are companies that are close to making it but missing a few points that eliminate them:

* Open discussions with vendors before eliminating them. 

* Give vendors feedback that allows them to understand why they are not advancing.

* Offer borderline vendors a chance to strengthen their proposals if they are invited to continue.

This mirrors how agile development itself works — iterative improvement based on feedback. It also builds vendor-government trust before award, aligning expectations and reducing post-award friction.

#### Example: Negotiation Opportunity During Code Challenge Phase

An agency issues an RFQ for an Agile web development team. After evaluating initial written submissions:

* Five vendors move to a code challenge phase.  
* Two vendors show strong technical proficiency but their code reveals architecture assumptions that conflict with the agency's goals (e.g., assuming the use of a commercial cloud service when the agency requires FedRAMP Moderate baseline compliance).

Rather than eliminating them immediately, the agency opens brief discussions:

* Explaining the misalignment.  
* Allowing vendors to clarify or adjust their approach in a final proposal revision.

As a result, one vendor substantially improves their design and security posture, becoming a strong finalist for award — and both the vendor and the Government avoid a potential costly misstep.

### Negotiations and Best Value 

It is important to note that negotiations are not necessarily about obtaining the lowest possible price. The goal of negotiations is to achieve best value — the most advantageous offer consistent with the acquisition’s needs and evaluation factors. Areas under negotiation might vary considerably based on the specifics of the acquisition; in addition to price, the Government might negotiate technical requirements, schedule, contract type, or terms of a proposed contract. 

**For example:** 

An agency has a requirement for a sensor that uses new, cutting-edge technology. The agency anticipates a high level of performance risk, so while price is an important factor, the focus of negotiations would be on technical factors and expertise. The negotiations may involve tradeoffs among price and reducing performance risk or achieving a higher level of performance. 

### Applicable Requirements and Guidance 

Negotiations are subject to a number of formal rules based on regulations, laws, and policies.  

The FAR states that the Contracting Officer (CO), at a minimum, must conduct negotiations with each offeror still under consideration for award. Negotiations must be meaningful and fair. This does not mean the CO must address the same issues with each offeror. 

Because of differences in proposals, negotiations may result in an extensive dialog with one offeror and a much briefer one with another. In either case, however, you must treat each offeror equitably.

###  Unique Aspects of Negotiations for Digital Services

When acquiring digital services, the Government needs to think and buy differently. As an example: The traditional model in which the Government owns or manages capital resources doesn’t apply with cloud services. Rather, cloud contracting is based on a consumption model, on paying for resources used on-demand.  In digital services, a number of acquisition issues have emerged, and obviously, these can impact negotiations.  

When entering negotiations in a digital services context, teams should actively focus on:

* **Technical Assumptions:** Identify assumptions embedded in vendor proposals, especially around hosting, security, scaling, and stakeholder availability.

* **Demonstration Gaps:** Use insights from code challenges or demos to clarify performance expectations or technical design choices.

* **Risk Mitigation Strategies:** Discuss approaches to areas identified as high-risk during earlier phases.

* **Scalability and Future Flexibility:** Ensure vendors understand future growth expectations even if immediate scope is small.

* **Data Rights and IP Terms:** Negotiate critical terms about custom code ownership, licensing, and portability up front.

* **Transparency and Team Dynamics:** Observe how vendors handle feedback — a strong predictor of how collaborative they will be during delivery.

### Key Strategies for Successful Negotiations with Vendors

Here are some key strategies for successfully negotiating with vendors during the solicitation process.

#### Success Strategy \#1: Use a Team Approach

Acquisition is a team-based process. From the earliest stages, acquisition personnel work as a team to develop the initial requirement, conduct market research, and identify criteria and processes that will be used to select the most favorable solution. To achieve the best value for the Government, this team-based approach should continue in contract negotiations. 

The negotiation team should include key members who were involved in defining requirements, developing the source selection process, and performing the evaluation. To ensure the necessary expertise, there should be representation of all key functional disciplines, including program and contracting staff, cost/price and other financial analysts, legal counsel, and technical experts.

#### Success Strategy \#2: Establish Negotiation Objectives

Negotiation objectives establish the Government’s initial negotiation position. The specific objectives are based on results of the team’s analysis of proposals, taking into consideration all pertinent information from the technical evaluation. With respect to cost/price proposals, objectives consider the Independent Government Cost Estimate, price history, fact finding, and audit reports. 

Because negotiation objectives will be different for each proposal, the CO should establish negotiation objectives for each offer/offeror.

As part of establishing negotiation objectives, the team should:

* Identify “must-haves.”

Based on what is important to the program office who has established the requirements, the team should determine in advance what the agency can and cannot live with. For example: The proposed labor rates for program developers are at full GSA Schedule contract rates; however, for similar acquisitions, the offeror traditionally discounts those Schedule rates by 30%. The must-have would be to secure discounts equal to or better than 30%. Another example: An offeror fails to provide subject matter experts to serve as part of the software development team. The Government feels that such expertise is a must-have. As such, this becomes a negotiation objective.

* Clearly define and document possible "tradeoffs."

To attain the best possible overall solution, negotiations often involve tradeoffs. There may be technical aspects of the solution that are so attractive the PM is willing to pay more. For example: An offeror proposes that 80% of transactions are processed within a standard timeframe. The PM prefers a rate of 90% or greater, but realizes that this higher rate will result in a higher price. While the higher rate is technically beneficial, the PM needs to consider if the tradeoff is worth it — if the higher benefit is worth the higher cost. 

* Identify and document any deficiencies and significant weaknesses that need to be discussed with the offeror. 

  o   A “deficiency” is a material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement, or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.

  o   A “significant weakness” is a flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. The CO should consider discussing any weakness that, if addressed, could materially enhance:

  1. The proposal’s potential for award; and  
  2. The likelihood of the Government receiving the best possible solution.

Identifying must-haves, tradeoffs, deficiencies, and significant weaknesses positions the Government to establish effective negotiation objectives. For example: Let’s say that in evaluating proposals for Agile development, the team notes that an offeror has proposed sprints of very long duration and limited use of a subject matter expert. The team sees both issues as significant weaknesses. As a result, the team’s negotiation objectives include having the offeror change its approach to sprints and provide the expert on a full-time basis. While this will probably increase the price to some degree, the team sees the technical benefits as worth the change in cost.

Once negotiation objectives are established, the team should review and reach a consensus on them. The CO then prepares the pre-negotiation memorandum and obtains any approvals consistent with agency policy.

#### Success Strategy \#3: Arrange for Logistics

It is important to address logistical considerations prior to conducting negotiation sessions.

When planning a time, consider the availability of all required Government personnel and offeror personnel. Allow enough lead time for both parties to assemble their teams. Consider the depth and breadth of the issues that will be covered, and allow reasonable time for discussion. This could be a couple hours for smaller acquisitions to a week or more for significant programs. |
| ![ ](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/f09c9e5d26ada1e17c911bf401125dc40609fc6b/Media/Module%203/arrange%20location.gif) | **Arrange for a Location**  <br> If the negotiation session will be face to face, arrange for a location. Generally, the Government will want to hold the session at its own site. However, there may be reasons to use a neutral site. (Conducting negotiations at the offeror’s location is generally considered the least desirable alternative.) Consider and prepare for related requirements, such as room size, seating capacity, and internet access.  In addition to conducting the negotiation session face to face, it may also be held via phone, video conference, or web meeting. |

Offerors will ask questions about revisions and their impacts, and the Government must have the right people to field these questions. Secure the support of the experts you think you may need, and avoid inviting people only because they are available. It is generally advisable to ask the offeror in advance who will be attending from its firm. This allows the Government to match expertise. For example, if the offeror is bringing legal experts to discuss intellectual property issues and licensing, the Government can ensure it has its counterparts at the meeting. In addition, if necessary/appropriate, the Government can place limits on the number of participants. |

The agenda should include items to be discussed and background information substantiating the Government’s position, if available.  In most instances, the agenda and any other read-ahead materials should be provided so the offeror has time to review them and be prepared to respond. |



#### Success Strategy \#4: Prepare the Team for the Negotiation Sessions

Prior to conducting negotiations, the team should prepare thoroughly. Each member should have a clear understanding of:

* The requirement and the solicitation  
* The source selection processes and evaluation factors/criteria outlined in the solicitation  
* The Independent Cost Estimate/Independent Government Cost Estimate, how it was prepared, and the budgeted amount available  
* The negotiation objectives for the specific negotiation session

Normally, the CO conducts negotiations, but it will be necessary for other Government team members to participate and answer questions as needed. As a result, the CO should ensure that each member understands their role and when they should respond to a contractor’s questions. In addition, the CO should ensure that each member understands what can and should be discussed and what should *not*. 

In preparation for the negotiation session(s), the CO should ensure that at least one team member will document the discussions. These notes will be provided as a summary to the offeror as a follow-up to the negotiations. To ensure accuracy, all team members should be encouraged to take their own notes as well. 

A best practice is … to practice. Rehearse with dry runs and mock negotiations so the entire team is well prepared and confident.

#### Success Strategy \#5: Adopt a Win-Win Attitude

The primary objective of negotiations is to maximize the Government’s ability to obtain best value. Keep this objective in mind.  

When conducting negotiations, encourage two-way communication and remain flexible in reaching compromises. It can be easy to lose sight of issues that may introduce risks to the contractor, add extra work or requirements, or require additional steps in performance. For example: When offering cloud computing services, it is a standard industry practice to bill the purchaser for resources consumed on a monthly basis. As such, providers track data on a monthly basis. However, the agency PM wants usage data tracked on a *daily* basis and wants the monthly projections updated *weekly*, even though actual usage is stable across the month. Providing the data the PM wants will require a major investment by the offeror. 

When negotiating for commercial services or products, keep in mind that any custom government-specific requirements — such as certifications, compliance standards, or performance metrics beyond what is typically offered commercially — are likely to drive up costs. It’s important to ensure that any items raised during negotiations are truly justifiable and mission-critical, rather than “nice-to-haves” or requirements that don’t align with the nature of the service or product being procured.

Other tips for conducting effective negotiations:  

**DO**

* Acknowledge the positive aspects of the proposal.  
* Ensure the discussions are “meaningful” — that you identify deficiencies and significant weaknesses and discuss the specific areas that require revision or modification. Make sure the offeror fully understands the Government’s concerns.   
*  Use language that is simple and commonly understood. The offeror may not understand agency-specific acronyms or jargon.  
*  If you don’t understand something, ask for clarification. Don’t make assumptions based on what you *think* you’ve heard.  
*  Follow the agenda. Make sure every item has been adequately addressed.  
*  Be fair, rational, and professional. 

**DON'T** 

* Play power games. This does not make the Government look good or promote goodwill with industry.  
* Allow the offeror to take control of discussions.  
*  Reveal the Government’s position on price.  
*  Disclose any information about another offeror and/or another offeror's proposal. 

#### Success Strategy \#6: Follow Up as Appropriate

Once negotiations have concluded, several follow-up actions may occur:  

* The Government may eliminate an offeror from further consideration because it no longer is considered part of the competitive range.    
  * The CO confirms the negotiations in writing with each offeror and requests a final proposal revision. The revised proposal reflects all changes the offeror agreed to in the course of the negotiations.  
  * After the Government receives the final proposal revisions, the evaluation team reconvenes and revises previous evaluation findings.   
  * Finally, a source is selected for contract award.

**Conclusion**

Negotiations can be daunting, but with planning and preparation, you can navigate the process with ease. Remember, at its core, negotiation is the process of coming to mutual agreement on the terms and conditions of a proposed contract with regard to price, schedule, technical requirements, type of contract, or other contract terms. A successful negotiation results in a meeting of the minds, and a mutually agreeable solution.
