## Understanding FAR 37.6: How Does Agile Methodology Fit Into Federal Acquisitions?

While FAR 37.6 does not specifically mention Agile methodologies, it aligns with the principles and practices that underpin Agile development approaches. Here’s how FAR 37.6 can be linked to Agile software development:

1\. **Outcome-Focused Approach:** FAR 37.6 emphasizes the importance of focusing on outcomes rather than prescribing specific methods or processes. Similarly, Agile software development emphasizes delivering value and achieving desired outcomes through iterative development and frequent feedback loops.

2\. **Flexibility and Adaptability:** Agile methodologies prioritize flexibility and adaptability in responding to changing requirements and stakeholder feedback. FAR 37.6 encourages agencies to structure contracts that provide flexibility and allow for adjustments based on evolving needs, aligning with Agile’s adaptive approach.

3\. **Collaboration and Communication:** Agile development emphasizes frequent collaboration and communication among stakeholders, including government agencies and contractors. FAR 37.6 promotes early engagement and collaboration between the government and industry partners to ensure a shared understanding of requirements and foster effective communication throughout the procurement process.

4\. **Iterative Delivery and Continuous Improvement:** Agile software development promotes iterative delivery, allowing for the early release of functional software components. FAR 37.6 supports the concept of progressive acquisition, where contracts are structured to enable incremental deliveries and continuous improvement, aligning with the iterative nature of Agile development.

While FAR 37.6 does not explicitly prescribe Agile methodologies, it provides a framework that aligns with the principles of Agile software development. By leveraging the flexibility, collaboration, iterative delivery, and outcome-focused approach of both FAR 37.6 and Agile, government agencies can foster more efficient and effective software development processes that deliver value to stakeholders.

It’s important to note that compliance with FAR 37.6 and the specific procurement regulations of government agencies is necessary when implementing Agile software development within a government context. Consulting with legal and procurement experts familiar with government regulations is recommended to ensure adherence to all applicable guidelines.

## Artificial Intelligence and the Acquisition Strategy

The use of AI in both the private and public sectors is a game changer. AI can help teams rapidly analyze vast amounts of data, enabling insights that can save significant time and resources. Businesses use AI to optimize enterprise resource systems, automate routine tasks, forecast consumer demand and behavior, and even innovate new products and services. 

Likewise, government agencies use AI to strengthen cybersecurity, ac­celerate data analysis, and even help commanders accelerate operational execution. While various uses of AI in acquisition are still being explored, there is little debate on the benefits. 

Before getting into AI and acqui­sition strategy development, let’s briefly review the two types of AI (predictive and generative) and how we might apply them.

### Predictive AI

Also known as predictive analytics, predictive AI employs machine learning to incorporate vast amounts of data and has been used for applications like insurance underwriting for centuries, even by Lloyd’s of London in the late 1600s.

In today’s environment, machine learning software develops a predictive model that finds patterns in the data and uses these patterns to make predictions. The model can also identify data anomalies that can be useful for applications like cybersecurity and risk mitigations. The typical business case involves using the AI-generated predictions to support business decisions  
that drive results such as increased sales and profits, additional customers, new products, and other business goals.

Using predictive AI in acquisition can take many forms. The following is a summary of ChatGPT’s and Microsoft Co-Pilot’s response to the question, “In what ways could predictive analytics be used in defense acquisition?”

>*Predictive analytics can significantly enhance defense acquisition in several ways. It can improve demand forecasting and budgeting by predicting costs and anticipating future needs, thus helping to set accurate budgets and allocate funds efficiently. In supply chain risk management, predictive models can assess supplier reliability and anticipate disruptions, allowing for better contingency planning. For cost estimation and lifecycle management, analytics can provide accurate cost predictions and forecast maintenance needs, leading to proactive planning and cost savings. Performance optimization is achieved by predicting contractor performance and optimizing operations to reduce downtime. It also supports talent and workforce planning by forecasting skill requirements and contractor staffing needs. Strategic decision support is enhanced through scenario planning and investment prioritization, while technology development and innovation forecasting help to identify emerging technologies.*

One of the key themes from this answer is forecasting future DoD needs in a proactive manner, using data to make informed decisions and optimize performance. This indicates two important benefits to acquisition strategy development. The acquisition strategy must consider future events well beyond the initial contracting action since it establishes a framework for the full system life cycle over many years, and even decades. Predicting trends and future scenarios can add great value as Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) consider what elements should be tailored to the strategy to position the program for future success.

The second benefit is derived from data-driven strategy decisions. Leveraging AI to rapidly analyze vast amounts of data enables IPTs to gain insights and patterns that may not be readily apparent without using the tool. AI can also save time and resources previously used on manual work or analytical methods.

Using AI in support of an acquisition strategy can result in data informed decisions, accelerated acquisition cycle time, saved resources, and help deliver greater value to the Warfighter. For example, an IPT is assessing long-term sustainment as part of the acquisition strategy for a new weapon system. The machine learning models expand the dimension of market research from the current state to what is coming, enabling informed decisions on current and future requirements. By using predictive AI to predict trends in obsolescence, material availability, supply chains, and reliability, IPTs can make informed decisions on strategy affecting the maintenance concept, data rights, and even the system’s technical architecture.

Predictive AI can also help to identify framing assumptions that are key suppositions central to shaping cost, schedule, and performance expectations. These critical assumptions, usually just a few, are documented in the acquisition strategy. Root cause analyses show that erroneous framing assumptions have resulted in significant acquisition baseline breaches that include cases where programs greatly exceeded their schedules and budgets. Since AI can predict trends with new technology advancements and other future outcomes, IPTs can use the tool to derive more accurate assumptions, enabling credible expectations at the program outset.

### Generative AI

A different and exciting dimension opens with generative AI, in which advanced computer programs analyze and *use* data to generate new content. Generative AI also relies on access to huge amounts of data. Thus, the quality of the new content can be related to the amount of data that the software can pull from. This can be a limiting factor for acquisition because of restricted access to sensitive data.

Here is what AI says about using generative AI in acquisition in response to the same prompt used about predictive AI: “In what ways could generative AI be used in defense acquisition?”

>*Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize defense acquisition processes by enhancing efficiency, decision-making, and innovation. It can automate requirement drafting by analyzing historical data and mission needs, identify gaps in current capabilities, and simulate operational scenarios to ensure mission-critical requirements are met. In concept development and prototyping, AI can generate multiple designs, create digital prototypes for rapid testing, and optimize performance. For procurement and contracting, AI can analyze supplier performance, draft procurement documents, and assess risks. In testing and evaluation, AI can simulate operational environments, optimize test plans, and analyze large volumes of test data. Life-cycle management benefits from predictive maintenance models, sustainment planning, and digital twins for real-time monitoring. AI can also generate realistic training scenarios, synthesize documents, and analyze historical data for knowledge management.*

In addition to applications highlighted here, generative AI can propose alternative solutions and even create initial drafts of the acquisition strategy. AI can “score” a draft strategy by grading the document, suggesting improvements, and identifying possible gaps. If used effectively, AI can save a lot of time in drafting the document and improving the strategy. However, we must distinguish between developing and writing the strategy.

### Developing the Acquisition Strategy

Strategy is one of the IPT’s most important tasks. Regardless of which pathway (or pathways) is selected, the acquisition strategy must integrate all of the program functional areas, risks, opportunities, and constraints into a comprehensive plan of action. Once the strategy is approved, it is difficult and costly to change since so many efforts are set in motion, including the Request for Proposal, Source Selection Plan, and the various functional plans that align with the strategy (e.g., Systems Engineering Plan, Product Support Plan). Thus, it is critical to develop a sound strategy at the program’s inception.

Developing an effective strategy requires critical thinking in analyzing information, developing assumptions, and forming judgments. This includes evaluating different alternatives before selecting an approach. That evaluation involves context, priorities, stakeholder interests, professional judgment, and many other factors that likely will not reside in any AI-produced plan. One could argue that AI makes critical thinking even more important as the access to content accelerates both in scale and in time.

AI has made significant progress in a short period of time, but its ability to think critically is still under debate. While AI can perform the predictive and generative tasks, it cannot determine all the surrounding background information associated with each program’s unique circumstances. This is where human judgment is needed to properly guide the thinking and machine learning outputs.

Innovation or creative thinking is another aspect of strategy development because we should use the human ability to think of new possi­bilities. While AI can generate new ideas and solutions based on existing data, “real” innovation involves the perception and human experience that AI currently lacks. As psycholo­gist and philosopher B. F. Skinner said, “The real problem is not whether ma­chines think but whether men do.” 

AI can play an important role in supporting innovation by providing frameworks that help inspire creativ­ity. One approach for using AI is to simply consolidate several concepts and generate a new and improved idea.

When we conduct the Acquisition Strategy Development Workshop ([WSM 014 in the DAU *iCatalog*](https://www.dau.edu/courses/wsm-014)) with intact teams, we always start with a discus­sion of critical thinking. This includes various thinking tools that can be used as the IPT develops the strat­egy concept. We then discuss topics that build on one another, starting with foundational matters such as critical success factors, program pri­orities, market research, framing as­sumptions, risks, opportunities, and technical drivers. Both predictive and generative AI can help the IPT build initial strategy concepts by predicting and generating content with the team in each area. The IPT must determine which content to consider and adopt based on all the background context we discussed previously.

### Writing the Acquisition Strategy

After deciding on the strategy, putting “pen to paper” is another important IPT task. The strategy should be fully documented so reviewers, approvers, and stakeholders understand the approach and why it was selected. 

AI likes using templates and assembling content within a prescribed format. AI can draft the document after using prompts to ensure that the software has the necessary information to tell the story. Users can experiment with different methods  
and prompts to construct the document since no single recipe exists on how best to do it. The following suggested practices can help elicit a useful AI response:

* Ensure that AI has significant background and context. Include recent events in “feeding” AI so it is up to date.  
* Emphasize points that you want included. Identify statutory, regulatory, and policy considerations that should be included.  
* Iterate multiple times to refine the document. Document the proven practices and share with others who can benefit.  
* Ensure that sensitive information and cybersecurity are protected within the AI environment.

### The Way Forward

Efforts are underway to examine the use of AI in developing and writing an acquisition strategy (and other key acquisition documents). We are still learning and, given the potential benefits, a coordinated effort could offer significant value. Harnessing the resources and expertise from a diverse group across defense acquisition can advance the use of this technology. If we accept the premise that the quality of the acquisition strategy is directly linked with subsequent acquisition outcomes, continued investment in AI and its optimal use can bring big returns on that investment. 

Given the objective of capturing lessons learned and best practices, please share your thoughts and feedback so we can continue this conversation. In the meantime, I’m looking forward to seeing how IPTs use this powerful tool to deliver Warfighter capabilities at higher speed and greater value\!
