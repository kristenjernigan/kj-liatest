# Module 3 Sprint 2

## Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and the Acquisition Strategy

As artificial intelligence (AI) reshapes both private industry and public sector operations, its application within acquisition strategy development offers a transformative opportunity. Predictive and generative AI technologies enable acquisition professionals to analyze vast amounts of data, forecast needs, automate documentation, and support decision-making throughout the program lifecycle. However, while these tools offer efficiency and insight, the success of an acquisition strategy still relies on critical thinking, human judgment, and an understanding of the unique context each program presents.

This module explores how predictive AI can improve forecasting and risk management, while generative AI supports content creation, prototyping, and innovation. Participants will also examine ethical and legal considerations for AI use in government, and shift their mindset from rigid Key Personnel-based acquisition to more flexible, outcome-based strategies. Learners will leave this module prepared to integrate AI responsibly and effectively into acquisition planning, leveraging its benefits while maintaining the human-centered principles essential for mission success.

### Learning Goals

* Understand how AI enhances acquisition strategy development.

* Recognize the differences and applications of predictive and generative AI.

* Explore the ethical, legal, and practical implications of using AI in federal acquisitions.

* Apply outcome-based thinking to contract planning, especially in agile delivery environments.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. **Explain** the role of predictive AI in forecasting costs, identifying supply chain risks, and improving lifecycle planning in defense acquisition.

2. **Describe the uses of generative AI** in automating acquisition document drafting, prototyping, and knowledge management.

3. **Differentiate** between developing and writing an acquisition strategy, and **articulate** where AI can add value in each process.

4. **Apply** ethical and legal frameworks to evaluate the use of AI tools in acquisition planning, referencing key policies and regulations.

5. **Assess** the advantages and limitations of using Key Personnel clauses in contracts versus outcome-based acquisition approaches.

6. **Construct** or critique a Statement of Objectives (SOO) that promotes vendor innovation and aligns with agile principles.
