# Module 3 Sprint 2

## Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and the Acquisition Strategy

As artificial intelligence (AI) reshapes both private industry and public sector operations, its application within acquisition strategy development offers a transformative opportunity. Predictive and generative AI technologies enable acquisition professionals to analyze vast amounts of data, forecast needs, automate documentation, and support decision-making throughout the program lifecycle. However, while these tools offer efficiency and insight, the success of an acquisition strategy still relies on critical thinking, human judgment, and an understanding of the unique context each program presents.

This module explores how predictive AI can improve forecasting and risk management, while generative AI supports content creation, prototyping, and innovation. Participants will also examine ethical and legal considerations for AI use in government, and shift their mindset from rigid Key Personnel-based acquisition to more flexible, outcome-based strategies. Learners will leave this module prepared to integrate AI responsibly and effectively into acquisition planning, leveraging its benefits while maintaining the human-centered principles essential for mission success.

### Learning Goals

* Understand how AI enhances acquisition strategy development.

* Recognize the differences and applications of predictive and generative AI.

* Explore the ethical, legal, and practical implications of using AI in federal acquisitions.

* Apply outcome-based thinking to contract planning, especially in agile delivery environments.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. **Explain** the role of predictive AI in forecasting costs, identifying supply chain risks, and improving lifecycle planning in defense acquisition.

2. **Describe the uses of generative AI** in automating acquisition document drafting, prototyping, and knowledge management.

3. **Differentiate** between developing and writing an acquisition strategy, and **articulate** where AI can add value in each process.

4. **Apply** ethical and legal frameworks to evaluate the use of AI tools in acquisition planning, referencing key policies and regulations.

5. **Assess** the advantages and limitations of using Key Personnel clauses in contracts versus outcome-based acquisition approaches.

6. **Construct** or critique a Statement of Objectives (SOO) that promotes vendor innovation and aligns with agile principles.

## Understanding FAR 37.6: How Does Agile Methodology Fit Into Federal Acquisitions?

While FAR 37.6 does not specifically mention Agile methodologies, it aligns with the principles and practices that underpin Agile development approaches. Here’s how FAR 37.6 can be linked to Agile software development:

1\. **Outcome-Focused Approach:** FAR 37.6 emphasizes the importance of focusing on outcomes rather than prescribing specific methods or processes. Similarly, Agile software development emphasizes delivering value and achieving desired outcomes through iterative development and frequent feedback loops.

2\. **Flexibility and Adaptability:** Agile methodologies prioritize flexibility and adaptability in responding to changing requirements and stakeholder feedback. FAR 37.6 encourages agencies to structure contracts that provide flexibility and allow for adjustments based on evolving needs, aligning with Agile’s adaptive approach.

3\. **Collaboration and Communication:** Agile development emphasizes frequent collaboration and communication among stakeholders, including government agencies and contractors. FAR 37.6 promotes early engagement and collaboration between the government and industry partners to ensure a shared understanding of requirements and foster effective communication throughout the procurement process.

4\. **Iterative Delivery and Continuous Improvement:** Agile software development promotes iterative delivery, allowing for the early release of functional software components. FAR 37.6 supports the concept of progressive acquisition, where contracts are structured to enable incremental deliveries and continuous improvement, aligning with the iterative nature of Agile development.

While FAR 37.6 does not explicitly prescribe Agile methodologies, it provides a framework that aligns with the principles of Agile software development. By leveraging the flexibility, collaboration, iterative delivery, and outcome-focused approach of both FAR 37.6 and Agile, government agencies can foster more efficient and effective software development processes that deliver value to stakeholders.

It’s important to note that compliance with FAR 37.6 and the specific procurement regulations of government agencies is necessary when implementing Agile software development within a government context. Consulting with legal and procurement experts familiar with government regulations is recommended to ensure adherence to all applicable guidelines.
