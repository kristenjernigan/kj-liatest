# Module 3 Sprint 1

## Introduction: Developing an Acquisition Strategy

Effective acquisition planning is essential for ensuring that government agencies deliver the right solutions to their users—on time, within budget, and aligned with mission needs. Whether adjusting an existing contract or developing a new procurement from the ground up, a well-documented acquisition strategy reduces risk, promotes transparency, and supports informed decision-making throughout the pre-award process.

This module introduces the foundational elements of acquisition strategy planning. Learners will explore how acquisition strategies are shaped by real-world circumstances, why documentation and rationale matter, and how the lean canvas approach can serve as a dynamic tool for refining strategy based on stakeholder input, market insights, and evolving user needs.

### **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Explain the purpose and value of acquisition strategy planning in the federal procurement lifecycle  
* Identify how acquisition strategies vary depending on inherited contracts versus new procurements  
* Apply key pre-award activities—such as stakeholder engagement and market research—to inform strategic decisions  
* Describe the lean canvas approach and its role as a living document in agile acquisition environments  
* Recognize when and how to update the acquisition strategy based on new inputs and evolving conditions

## Why Do We Plan?

Just as in our personal lives, in the government, we plan so that we reduce the risk of buying the wrong solution. We want to ensure we are buying the solution our users need at a price we can afford.  As you may know from your on-the-job experience, acquisition planning and the strategy will differ somewhat depending on a few factors:

* You may inherit an existing contract that requires adjustment, so you will need to build a strategy for making those adjustments.  
* You may be involved in developing a new strategy for a new procurement.

In either case, it is important to document all of the decisions made throughout the pre-award process and include what led you to those decisions. This support rationale will come from all of the pre-award activities you have conducted, from product visions to market research, and all communications with stakeholders.

Each time you update or complete an activity, you will want to revise your acquisition strategy and document it using the lean canvas approach that you learned about in the Module 2. This lean canvas is a living document and will evolve as you refine your strategy and gain input from stakeholders and the vendor community. You will learn more about the lean canvas later in this module.

## What Feeds the Acquisition Strategy?

Planning your acquisition strategy helps you lay out the scheduling, integration, and coordination of all acquisition-related efforts and is an essential and required component of all acquisitions. It should begin as soon as you identify the need for the acquisition.

There are many considerations that feed the development of an acquisition strategy. It begins with the Product Vision, the principal driver of the overall acquisition solution (refer to the [Requirements Development and Acquisition Planning](https://techfarhub.cio.gov/handbook/requirements/) section of the TechFAR for more discussion of the Product Vision and the Module 2 content). The Product Vision also influences how other conditions and considerations in both the market and your acquisition environment will be handled in the acquisition solution. Conditions and considerations as they exist in the market and at your agency may have either positive or negative impacts on the acquisition strategy and solution. You want to plan for these impacts to seize opportunities and mitigate potential problems.

These other conditions and considerations include, but are not limited to:

* Stakeholder engagement, including their level of capability and cooperation  
* Availability and applicability of existing contract vehicles  
* New contract vehicle considerations  
* Contract type and pricing structure  
* Funding and programmatic considerations  
* Legacy systems and services, i.e., technical requirements, security concerns, risk, etc.  
* State of the market  
* How you will evaluate vendor quotes/proposals

We will discuss each of these in more detail as we go, but recognize that none exist in a vacuum. Each has the potential to impact the other considerations, which can substantially affect the ultimate acquisition strategy and solution. Understanding these conditions and considerations as they apply to your acquisition and Product Vision is key to effective planning.

## Getting to Know Your Office of General Counsel

Every civilian and military agency has an Office of General Counsel (OGC). The OGC deals with many potential or actual legal concerns, including environmental protection, FOIA, human resources, budget and finance, and acquisition. Acquisition matters may include any number of areas, from CICA, labor law, and procurement integrity to OCI, IP, and source selection.

Regardless, your OGC is a stakeholder. At some point or another, an OGC will be giving your procurement a determination of legal sufficiency or denying one. Depending on the agency's organizational structure, one or more may be assigned to your contracting office to deal with contracting issues. How and when they get involved in your acquisition will depend quite a bit on your agency’s operating procedures. Some agencies have their OGC involved throughout the acquisition process. At the same time, many aren’t staffed to provide that level of support, preferring to engage as a reviewer only once the acquisition decisions have been made or during particular acquisition cycle milestones. Additionally, as discussed during the course orientation, many are unfamiliar with leading practices involving digital services acquisition and may provide more hindrance than help in bringing your acquisition to fruition.

So, how to make the most effective use of your limited OGC resources in procuring digital services becomes a pressing job skill. Fundamentally, you need the OGC to provide two basic services:

1. Provide advice on how to best proceed with your acquisition strategy  
2. Advice on how to adjust your acquisition strategy to either improve it or make it legally sufficient

Your OGC may not have in-depth knowledge of your program or acquisition, making it more difficult for them to bring their expertise to bear. Some strategies to streamline and improve this process and relationship include:

* Develop a relationship with the person(s) in the OGC office whose knowledge and input will be most valuable. Find out who the IP expert is or who is willing to learn about leading practices in digital services acquisition.
  
* If you’re faced with a difficult question on a complicated topic, ask for OGC help early. Figuring out what is reasonable and enforceable regarding government data rights and intellectual property and incorporating that information early in your acquisition strategy will allow for a more coherent, compliant solicitation and source selection plan.
  
* Do the research yourself. Synopsize and provide references (e.g., GAO decisions, policy, regulation, statute, acquisition guidance documents) supporting your position. Provide both sides of a position and alternatives, but back up your desired course with compelling references. Be complete, but succinct. They just need to know that your argument is complete and in the government’s best interest and that backing you won’t hurt them.

## What is Intellectual Property?

In a digital age, Intellectual Property (IP) isn’t as easy to safeguard as it has been in the past. In the days past, an artist such as Van Gogh would paint something, and it would be a one-of-a-kind piece that would be sold by the artist only once. Now that you can re-print a canvas, you can buy multiple copies of The Starry Night. However, the painting—the original image—is still the artist's intellectual property and resides in a museum. So, how does he (his estate) get compensated for reprints? How can this artist monitor or account for people who find the image online and upload it to a local printer or website to create their own canvas re-print? Of course, these sorts of questions extend to all digital media. If it is on the internet, can it be kept safe? Can we prevent people from obtaining a movie illegally or sharing music?

![The Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/03179a35315f8ecd02c79dc75d24b6fd360d0104/Media/Module%203/The%20Starry%20Night%20-%20Vincent%20van%20Gogh.jpg) 

When buying digital services, you can apply many of these concepts to the government. IP is protected in law through patents, copyright, and trademarks, which enable people to earn recognition or financial benefit from what they invent or create.

## Types of IP

Let’s begin with definitions of IP and then shift into how it directly affects you in the acquisition world. There are many ways to categorize intellectual property. These are the main categories:

|  |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| ![ ](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/f6b3a8c6266cbe72eca1c0ab63db9c4c957b08de/Media/Module%203/Copyright.jpg)  | **Copyright** is a legal term used to describe creators' rights over their literary and artistic works. Copyrighted works include books, music, paintings, sculpture, and films, as well as computer programs, databases, advertisements, maps, and technical drawings.  |
| ![ ](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/f6b3a8c6266cbe72eca1c0ab63db9c4c957b08de/Media/Module%203/Patent.jpg)  | A **patent** is an exclusive right granted for an invention. Generally speaking, a patent gives the owner the right to decide how—or whether—others can use the invention. In exchange for this right, the patent owner makes technical information about the invention publicly available in the published patent document. |
| ![ ](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/f6b3a8c6266cbe72eca1c0ab63db9c4c957b08de/Media/Module%203/Trademark.jpg)  | A **trademark** is a sign capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one enterprise from those of other enterprises. Trademarks date back to ancient times when craftsmen used to put their signature or "mark" on their products.   |
| ![ ](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/f6b3a8c6266cbe72eca1c0ab63db9c4c957b08de/Media/Module%203/industrial%20design.jpg) | An **industrial design** constitutes the ornamental or aesthetic aspect of an article. A design may consist of three-dimensional features, such as the article's shape or surface, or two-dimensional features, such as patterns, lines, or color.   |
|![ ](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/f6b3a8c6266cbe72eca1c0ab63db9c4c957b08de/Media/Module%203/Geographical.jpg)  | **Geographical indications and appellations** **of origin** are signs used on goods with a specific geographical origin and possessing qualities, a reputation, or characteristics that are essentially attributable to that place of origin. Most commonly, a geographical indication includes the name of the place of origin of the goods. For example, Napa Valley is an appellation in California known for its unique growing conditions for producing wine.  |


### Digital media rights

The government has put in place measures to protect all types of IP. When considering digital services, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a vital copyright law to be familiar with. DMCA is a U.S. copyright law that implements two 1996 World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) treaties. It criminalizes:

* Production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent measures (commonly known as digital rights management or DRM) that control access to copyrighted works.  
* The act of circumventing an access control, whether or not there is actual infringement of copyright itself.

In addition, the DMCA heightens the penalties for copyright infringement on the internet.

## FAR Subpart 27.4 Rights in Data and Copyrights

Digital services acquisition—particularly acquisitions involving software development or existing proprietary solutions—is substantially impacted by the contractual arrangements for data rights between the contractor and the government. These arrangements affect competition, legal liability, lifecycle costs, and related issues.

Accordingly, digital services acquisition professionals like you must be familiar with and understand FAR 27.4 and its clauses. Under FAR 27.402, and as discussed previously in this program, agencies may require data to be delivered under contracts, and the ability to use or disclose it, to:

(1) Obtain competition among suppliers;  
(2) Fulfill specific responsibilities for disseminating and publishing the results of their activities;  
(3) Ensure appropriate utilization of the results of research, development, and demonstration activities, including the dissemination of technical information to foster subsequent technological developments;  
(4) Meet other programmatic and statutory requirements; and  
(5) Meet specialized acquisition needs and ensure logistics support.

Conversely, contractors may have proprietary interests in data that provide competitive advantages in the commercial or government marketplace or both. Protection of legitimate proprietary data from unauthorized use and disclosure “…is necessary to encourage qualified contractors to participate in and apply innovative concepts to Government programs. In light of these considerations, *agencies shall balance the Government's needs and the contractor’s legitimate proprietary interests.”*

[**Video - Data Rights: Understanding and Negotiating Data Rights**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZBys4jBZOk)


### What does “data” mean, and how does it apply to data rights and copyrights?

FAR 27.401 defines data in the following ways:

* “Data” means recorded information, regardless of form or the media on which it may be recorded. The term *includes technical data and computer software*. The term *does not* *include information incidental to contract administration, such as financial, administrative, cost or pricing, or management information.*  
* “Form, fit, and function data”: For computer software, this means data identifying the source, functional characteristics, and performance requirements, but it *specifically excludes the source code, algorithms, processes, formulas, and flow charts of the software*.  
* “Restricted computer software” means computer software *developed at private expense and that is a trade secret; is commercial or financial and confidential or privileged; or is copyrighted computer software, including minor modifications of such computer software.*

While the definitions and resulting data rights under a contract may seem straightforward, many issues must be considered when deciding who (the contractor and the government) gets which type of rights to what data in any particular contract. The clauses and alternates associated with this FAR part provide a variety of arrangements and tailoring to support the government and contractor’s interests, given the particular circumstances of any digital services acquisition.

It’s important to note that in federal acquisition, the contractor is responsible for claiming proprietary data and marking it as such when delivered to the government. Absent such claims and markings, the contractor may not be able to enforce limitations on the government’s rights to that data.

When data is first produced under the performance of the contract, the government historically prefers complete contractor ownership of the data to encourage commercial development; however, the government often retains complete license to the data without fees or cost in perpetuity. While this practice was mainly for hardware, equipment, and supplies developed and delivered under contract at government expense, the principle applies to software, even software solutions developed using open source code. The potential for applying the solution, in whole or in part, to commercial markets is a powerful incentive for commercial contractors to engage in government contracts and a source of potential government leverage in negotiations.

## Contribution, Attribution, Retribution…Oh My\!

Open source means public domain, right? Short answer is…wrong. Even open-source software has licensing agreements and copyright protections. These affect how open source software is developed, used, maintained, upgraded, and when used to develop custom software, the IP rights of the developer. The Business Software Alliance's “Open Source and Commercial Software \- An In-Depth Analysis” paper is an excellent primer for this issue and many others related to IP in open source software. The paper describes open source and IP as follows:

*“Open Source” is a software-licensing model where the software's source code is typically made royalty-free to the software users, under terms allowing redistribution, modification, and addition, though often with certain restrictions. The support, training, updates, and other services for the software may be provided by a range of entities, increasingly under commercial arrangements. Open source programs are often, though not exclusively, developed through a collaborative effort in which several persons contribute elements of the final software. Software companies also contribute paid programmer time and in-house programs to the open source community.”*

So, how does this affect the government's acquisition of professionals? The data rights arena directly affects what the custom software developer can claim as restricted data or proprietary software in the delivered solution. Because open source code can be integrated with proprietary software in developing a solution, it also impacts the type, magnitude, and level of open software components the contractor may incorporate. For a better understanding, let’s look at the two main types of open software licensing agreements typically in use today.

### GNU General Public License (GPL)

Developers using open source software under a GPL cannot sell “derivative” works they develop from the software at more than the nominal distribution cost. Because the source code is subject to the GPL in the solution, both the developer and the customer are subject to the terms of the GPL for the source code of that derivative work. This means the customer can make copies and distribute the software to as many people or agencies as desired with no additional payments due to the developer. 

While this presents a problem for the contractor in making its developed solution commercially viable, the contractor can charge what the market will bear for setup, installation, training, and other services supporting the software installation and operation.

The GPL is not a standard, one-size-fits-all document, and there are more than a few variants established by organizations that control open source software to fit their commercial, cultural, and mission needs.

### Berkley Software Distribution (BSD) License

Open source software subject to the BSD License is more easily converted to a commercially viable product for developers because they can integrate their own source code and then market and distribute the resulting software under more traditional IP and commercial software licensing arrangements.

Digital services acquisition professionals like you should understand these two licensing arrangements regarding government rights in data and the proposed solution(s) to be acquired. While the effectiveness of the proposed/contracted solution for the agency’s mission is paramount, licensing agreements can affect IP claims, which will in turn affect sustainment and maintenance, and access and rights to data (including the cost of distributing the software solution to other agencies or components).

---
## Who Owns Open Source Code?

As covered in the previous section, open source doesn’t necessarily mean public domain. In addition, ownership of software solutions developed from open source platforms depends significantly on the terms of the licensing agreement issued by the controlling organization and the terms and conditions of the contract under which the government acquired it. 

If you interpret ownership as the ability to control something, then the range and depth of that control define effective ownership. Complete “ownership” of open source will never truly be attained by the government since the open source code is managed and maintained by the controlling organization (e.g., Mozilla, Ruby on Rails), in joint ownership with the contributors, under the terms of the applicable licensing agreement.

However, the licensing agreement, together with the negotiated terms and conditions of the contract, can provide the government with sufficient control to support the acquisition requirements, both long-term and short-term.

From previous content and discussion in the program, we know that open source can offer a path to effective software solutions without the IP issues and cost of proprietary solutions. In effect, it can provide effective government control and ownership of the solution.

The principle of First Performance is also key. Generally, when the software solution is first developed under a government contract at government expense, the government gets unrestricted rights to the solution. However, it is rarely as clean as that. The software solution may incorporate First Performance data with open source (GPL or BSD) and previously developed proprietary (restricted) software. Ownership of the data and IP assignment gets more complicated in such conditions.

The data rights clauses prescribed in FAR Part 27 allow for establishing the parties' data rights and ownership, as well as mechanisms for asserting those rights in the contract. However, suppose the government asserts the need for specific government rights for parts of, or the entirety of, the solution. In that case, that needs to be established in the solicitation, made a condition for source selection, negotiated, and memorialized in the resulting contract requirements and clauses. To the maximum extent possible, both parties should understand the government's and contractor's IP and data rights going in to minimize problems later.

## Data in the Cloud (It’s Cloudy Out There\!)

What about data in the cloud? Here are some common questions and answers about such data.

### Q: If I store my data in the cloud, does that make it public?

A: No. Just as commercial sector customers using cloud services expect security and privacy for the data or content stored in the cloud, the government also has that reasonable expectation. Supporting that expectation is the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FEDRAMP), which supports the certification and listing of cloud providers who meet strict security and reliability requirements for content stored in their infrastructure.

### Q: Does storing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in the cloud mean I don’t have to get authorization to establish a database with PII?

A: No. The statutory requirements for establishing a system or database that collects or stores PII cannot be circumvented, regardless of where that system or database resides. If archiving functions or processing are moved to the cloud, a complete approval process for a system may be required, or merely certification that the repository is secure. Consult your HR, Security, and Agency Counsel.

### Q: If my custom software solution is deployed in a cloud service (SaaS), does that mean the government can’t get unlimited data rights for the software?

A: No, cloud storage has no impact on data rights.

### Q: My custom software solution and corresponding database are in the cloud. Does it have to stay that way? What if I need to switch development contractors down the road?

A: No. Assuming the government obtained rights in the custom solution (which they should), they can choose to store it wherever they want. The complication here is that if the solution was developed to operate in the cloud, it may be financially or time-prohibitive to move it.

## Legal Liabilities

You need to consider your IP rights and protection, and any potential legal liabilities that could arise with your digital service. Examples include latent defects and patent defects.

### Patent defects

The government should notice patent defects upon a “reasonable” inspection of the delivered service or supply. 

For example, your agency’s website requires public users to input Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to interact with the agency; however, the PII input screen does not appear upon login. 

You have a patent defect. If the government had been monitoring performance and delivery adequately, it would have discovered the software's lack of adequate security. In such a circumstance, the assignment of liability between the contractor and the government may be a bit contentious. It will probably hinge on the specific requirements of the contract document.

### Latent defects

Latent defects are different. Those defects are not discoverable in a reasonable inspection of the delivered service or supply. For example:

1. The developer provided documentation for the required security testing of a prior obsolete version of the code instead of the delivered version.  
2. The organization that maintains the open source code used in your custom solution had issued two major security patches a week before the contractor delivered the latest release, and the contractor neglected to mention the discovered vulnerabilities or implement the available patches.  
3. The software failed to produce a retroactive listing of annual patches.

You may have a latent defect. The contractor knew, but whether the government could have reasonably discovered this before delivery and deployment is unclear. If the government were reasonably expected to inventory vulnerability patches, maybe. Resolution, again, depends on the terms and conditions of the contract. Did the contract require all patches to be current as of the delivery date? Was the government’s reliance on the contractor’s documentation reasonable? Legal precedent indicates that it could be the case.

However, the best approach is an adequate testing regime (automated, preferably), combined with a proper definition of done that supports reliable examination of the delivered functionality. Good communication between team members (government and contractor) will help identify where required testing and inspection may be inadequate and how to resolve the issue before it becomes a problem. Sometimes it’s more productive to focus on fixing the problem instead of assigning blame and equitable adjustments.

## What Happens When Open Source Software Breaks?

If you are developing software using open-source software as your foundation, there’s potential for malfunctions. The question is, who’s responsible if the software stops working? This needs to be built into the contract to protect the government. You’ll want to ensure that the contractor/vendor is responsible for fixing the software, no matter where it comes from or how they built it.

In the case of commercial software, the vendor owns the source code, and liability for the performance of the code is clear since they control it from start to finish. This concept doesn’t directly apply to solutions developed using open source since the contractor doesn’t “own” the code. The contractor doesn’t control releases or upgrades, and doesn’t control identification or patching of vulnerabilities in the software. Nor is the open source software’s controlling organization a subcontractor that can be held accountable through a contractual relationship with the “prime” applicable to its contract with the government. The licensing agreement for the open source platform makes no guarantees or warranties about suitability, reliability, or merchantability, nor is there consideration involved.

### Third-party developers

The third-party developer (the open source licensee) proposes that the open source software to be used is suitable for the need and will meet the contractual requirements. In the proposal evaluation process, the government will determine whether that assertion is realistic and backed up by historical information in the commercial and government markets.

In evaluating whether the third-party developer’s use of a particular open-source platform for the custom software solution is reasonable regarding performance risk, the government has several approaches available:

* Evaluate aspects of past performance or experience, including experience with open-source software such as contributions to the base version (e.g., upgrades, patches) accepted by the controlling organization and projects successfully completed using the specific open-source software.  
* Evaluate reliability and compliance stats with industry standards, including testing and security regimes.  
* Examine the third-party developer risk mitigation and corrective methods for the open-source software in case it breaks. Does the developer have any documented experience in this area?

Actions the government can take when implementing to reduce risks include:

* Incorporate testing procedures and test environment for new releases before deploying to the production environment.  
* Use backups to restore the previous release configuration when the new release breaks things.  
* Is the open-source software white-listed at your agency? That’s a good indicator of lower risk using that software.  
* Be prepared to pay for maintenance and support. If your solution was written in Ruby on Rails 4.0 and your agency just upgraded to 4.2, are you sure everything will keep working?  
* If agency personnel modify the software themselves, all bets are off, and vendor liability will likely evaporate.

Understand that the offeror has to sell you on his choice of open source software and his ability to manage the risks of using what he doesn’t own. Ensure your solicitation is clear: you must be comfortable with the risks of using a proposed open source platform being manageable and palatable. Also, ensure that the vendor is ready to be contractually obligated to deal with problems arising from using a particular open source platform.
