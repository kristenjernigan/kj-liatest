## Compliance & Other Legal Issues

This online module will teach you about regulatory compliance, legal considerations, and risk avoidance/mitigation when procuring digital services. It will address significant challenges identified in acquiring digital services and provide guidance and best practices to address those challenges. Specifically, it will address intellectual property and data rights and how to protect your data in a digital service environment.

After this module, you’ll be able to:

* Describe intellectual property and your rights as the procuring agency in maintaining those rights.  
* Recognize the legal considerations that are unique to digital service acquisition.  
* Describe the potential risks inherent in acquiring digital services and risk avoidance and mitigation methods.

## Getting to Know Your Office of General Counsel

Every civilian and military agency has an Office of General Counsel (OGC). The OGC deals with many potential or actual legal concerns, including environmental protection, FOIA, human resources, budget and finance, and acquisition. Acquisition matters may include any number of areas, from CICA, labor law, and procurement integrity to OCI, IP, and source selection.

Regardless, your OGC is a stakeholder. At some point or another, an OGC will be giving your procurement a determination of legal sufficiency or denying one. Depending on the agency's organizational structure, one or more may be assigned to your contracting office to deal with contracting issues. How and when they get involved in your acquisition will depend quite a bit on your agency’s operating procedures. Some agencies have their OGC involved throughout the acquisition process. At the same time, many aren’t staffed to provide that level of support, preferring to engage as a reviewer only once the acquisition decisions have been made or during particular acquisition cycle milestones. Additionally, as discussed during the course orientation, many are unfamiliar with leading practices involving digital services acquisition and may provide more hindrance than help in bringing your acquisition to fruition.

So, how to make the most effective use of your limited OGC resources in procuring digital services becomes a pressing job skill. Fundamentally, you need the OGC to provide two basic services:

1. Provide advice on how to best proceed with your acquisition strategy  
2. Advice on how to adjust your acquisition strategy to either improve it or make it legally sufficient

Your OGC may not have in-depth knowledge of your program or acquisition, making it more difficult for them to bring their expertise to bear. Some strategies to streamline and improve this process and relationship include:

* Develop a relationship with the person(s) in the OGC office whose knowledge and input will be most valuable. Find out who the IP expert is or who is willing to learn about leading practices in digital services acquisition.
  
* If you’re faced with a difficult question on a complicated topic, ask for OGC help early. Figuring out what is reasonable and enforceable regarding government data rights and intellectual property and incorporating that information early in your acquisition strategy will allow for a more coherent, compliant solicitation and source selection plan.
  
* Do the research yourself. Synopsize and provide references (e.g., GAO decisions, policy, regulation, statute, acquisition guidance documents) supporting your position. Provide both sides of a position and alternatives, but back up your desired course with compelling references. Be complete, but succinct. They just need to know that your argument is complete and in the government’s best interest and that backing you won’t hurt them.

## What is Intellectual Property?

In a digital age, Intellectual Property (IP) isn’t as easy to safeguard as it has been in the past. In the days past, an artist such as Van Gogh would paint something, and it would be a one-of-a-kind piece that would be sold by the artist only once. Now that you can re-print a canvas, you can buy multiple copies of The Starry Night. However, the painting—the original image—is still the artist's intellectual property and resides in a museum. So, how does he (his estate) get compensated for reprints? How can this artist monitor or account for people who find the image online and upload it to a local printer or website to create their own canvas re-print? Of course, these sorts of questions extend to all digital media. If it is on the internet, can it be kept safe? Can we prevent people from obtaining a movie illegally or sharing music?

When buying digital services, you can apply many of these concepts to the government. IP is protected in law through patents, copyright, and trademarks, which enable people to earn recognition or financial benefit from what they invent or create.

## Types of IP

Let’s begin with definitions of IP and then shift into how it directly affects you in the acquisition world. There are many ways to categorize intellectual property. These are the main categories:

|  |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| ![ ](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/f6b3a8c6266cbe72eca1c0ab63db9c4c957b08de/Media/Module%203/Copyright.jpg)  | **Copyright** is a legal term used to describe creators' rights over their literary and artistic works. Copyrighted works include books, music, paintings, sculpture, and films, as well as computer programs, databases, advertisements, maps, and technical drawings.  |
| ![ ](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/f6b3a8c6266cbe72eca1c0ab63db9c4c957b08de/Media/Module%203/Patent.jpg)  | A **patent** is an exclusive right granted for an invention. Generally speaking, a patent gives the owner the right to decide how—or whether—others can use the invention. In exchange for this right, the patent owner makes technical information about the invention publicly available in the published patent document. |
| ![ ](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/f6b3a8c6266cbe72eca1c0ab63db9c4c957b08de/Media/Module%203/Trademark.jpg)  | A **trademark** is a sign capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one enterprise from those of other enterprises. Trademarks date back to ancient times when craftsmen used to put their signature or "mark" on their products.   |
| ![ ](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/f6b3a8c6266cbe72eca1c0ab63db9c4c957b08de/Media/Module%203/industrial%20design.jpg) | An **industrial design** constitutes the ornamental or aesthetic aspect of an article. A design may consist of three-dimensional features, such as the article's shape or surface, or two-dimensional features, such as patterns, lines, or color.   |

Most commonly, a geographical indication includes the name of the place of origin of the goods. For example, Napa Valley is an appellation in California known for its unique growing conditions for producing wine.  |


### Digital media rights

The government has put in place measures to protect all types of IP. When considering digital services, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a vital copyright law to be familiar with. DMCA is a U.S. copyright law that implements two 1996 World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) treaties. It criminalizes:

* Production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent measures (commonly known as digital rights management or DRM) that control access to copyrighted works.  
  * The act of circumventing an access control, whether or not there is actual infringement of copyright itself.

In addition, the DMCA heightens the penalties for copyright infringement on the internet.
