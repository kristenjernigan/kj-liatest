## Compliance & Other Legal Issues

This online module will teach you about regulatory compliance, legal considerations, and risk avoidance/mitigation when procuring digital services. It will address significant challenges identified in acquiring digital services and provide guidance and best practices to address those challenges. Specifically, it will address intellectual property and data rights and how to protect your data in a digital service environment.

After this module, you’ll be able to:

* Describe intellectual property and your rights as the procuring agency in maintaining those rights.

## Getting to Know Your Office of General Counsel

Every civilian and military agency has an Office of General Counsel (OGC). The OGC deals with many potential or actual legal concerns, including environmental protection, FOIA, human resources, budget and finance, and acquisition. Acquisition matters may include any number of areas, from CICA, labor law, and procurement integrity to OCI, IP, and source selection.

Regardless, your OGC is a stakeholder. At some point or another, an OGC will be giving your procurement a determination of legal sufficiency or denying one. Depending on the agency's organizational structure, one or more may be assigned to your contracting office to deal with contracting issues. How and when they get involved in your acquisition will depend quite a bit on your agency’s operating procedures. Some agencies have their OGC involved throughout the acquisition process. At the same time, many aren’t staffed to provide that level of support, preferring to engage as a reviewer only once the acquisition decisions have been made or during particular acquisition cycle milestones. Additionally, as discussed during the course orientation, many are unfamiliar with leading practices involving digital services acquisition and may provide more hindrance than help in bringing your acquisition to fruition.

So, how to make the most effective use of your limited OGC resources in procuring digital services becomes a pressing job skill. Fundamentally, you need the OGC to provide two basic services:

1. Provide advice on how to best proceed with your acquisition strategy  
   2. Advice on how to adjust your acquisition strategy to either improve it or make it legally sufficient

Your OGC may not have in-depth knowledge of your program or acquisition, making it more difficult for them to bring their expertise to bear. Some strategies to streamline and improve this process and relationship include:

* Develop a relationship with the person(s) in the OGC office whose knowledge and input will be most valuable. Find out who the IP expert is or who is willing to learn about leading practices in digital services acquisition.  
  * If you’re faced with a difficult question on a complicated topic, ask for OGC help early. Figuring out what is reasonable and enforceable regarding government data rights and intellectual property and incorporating that information early in your acquisition strategy will allow for a more coherent, compliant solicitation and source selection plan.  
  * Do the research yourself. Synopsize and provide references (e.g., GAO decisions, policy, regulation, statute, acquisition guidance documents) supporting your position. Provide both sides of a position and alternatives, but back up your desired course with compelling references. Be complete, but succinct. They just need to know that your argument is complete and in the government’s best interest and that backing you won’t hurt them.

## What is Intellectual Property?

In a digital age, Intellectual Property (IP) isn’t as easy to safeguard as it has been in the past. In the days past, an artist such as Van Gogh would paint something, and it would be a one-of-a-kind piece that would be sold by the artist only once. Now that you can re-print a canvas, you can buy multiple copies of The Starry Night. However, the painting—the original image—is still the artist's intellectual property and resides in a museum. So, how does he (his estate) get compensated for reprints? How can this artist monitor or account for people who find the image online and upload it to a local printer or website to create their own canvas re-print? Of course, these sorts of questions extend to all digital media. If it is on the internet, can it be kept safe? Can we prevent people from obtaining a movie illegally or sharing music?

When buying digital services, you can apply many of these concepts to the government. IP is protected in law through patents, copyright, and trademarks, which enable people to earn recognition or financial benefit from what they invent or create.
