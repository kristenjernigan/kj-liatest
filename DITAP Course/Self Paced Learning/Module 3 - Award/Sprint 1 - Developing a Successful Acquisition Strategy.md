## Getting to Know Your Office of General Counsel

Every civilian and military agency has an Office of General Counsel (OGC). The OGC deals with many potential or actual legal concerns, including environmental protection, FOIA, human resources, budget and finance, and acquisition. Acquisition matters may include any number of areas, from CICA, labor law, and procurement integrity to OCI, IP, and source selection.

Regardless, your OGC is a stakeholder. At some point or another, an OGC will be giving your procurement a determination of legal sufficiency or denying one. Depending on the agency's organizational structure, one or more may be assigned to your contracting office to deal with contracting issues. How and when they get involved in your acquisition will depend quite a bit on your agency’s operating procedures. Some agencies have their OGC involved throughout the acquisition process. At the same time, many aren’t staffed to provide that level of support, preferring to engage as a reviewer only once the acquisition decisions have been made or during particular acquisition cycle milestones. Additionally, as discussed during the course orientation, many are unfamiliar with leading practices involving digital services acquisition and may provide more hindrance than help in bringing your acquisition to fruition.

So, how to make the most effective use of your limited OGC resources in procuring digital services becomes a pressing job skill. Fundamentally, you need the OGC to provide two basic services:

1. Provide advice on how to best proceed with your acquisition strategy  
2. Advice on how to adjust your acquisition strategy to either improve it or make it legally sufficient

Your OGC may not have in-depth knowledge of your program or acquisition, making it more difficult for them to bring their expertise to bear. Some strategies to streamline and improve this process and relationship include:

* Develop a relationship with the person(s) in the OGC office whose knowledge and input will be most valuable. Find out who the IP expert is or who is willing to learn about leading practices in digital services acquisition.
  
* If you’re faced with a difficult question on a complicated topic, ask for OGC help early. Figuring out what is reasonable and enforceable regarding government data rights and intellectual property and incorporating that information early in your acquisition strategy will allow for a more coherent, compliant solicitation and source selection plan.
  
* Do the research yourself. Synopsize and provide references (e.g., GAO decisions, policy, regulation, statute, acquisition guidance documents) supporting your position. Provide both sides of a position and alternatives, but back up your desired course with compelling references. Be complete, but succinct. They just need to know that your argument is complete and in the government’s best interest and that backing you won’t hurt them.

## What is Intellectual Property?

In a digital age, Intellectual Property (IP) isn’t as easy to safeguard as it has been in the past. In the days past, an artist such as Van Gogh would paint something, and it would be a one-of-a-kind piece that would be sold by the artist only once. Now that you can re-print a canvas, you can buy multiple copies of The Starry Night. However, the painting—the original image—is still the artist's intellectual property and resides in a museum. So, how does he (his estate) get compensated for reprints? How can this artist monitor or account for people who find the image online and upload it to a local printer or website to create their own canvas re-print? Of course, these sorts of questions extend to all digital media. If it is on the internet, can it be kept safe? Can we prevent people from obtaining a movie illegally or sharing music?

When buying digital services, you can apply many of these concepts to the government. IP is protected in law through patents, copyright, and trademarks, which enable people to earn recognition or financial benefit from what they invent or create.

## Types of IP

Let’s begin with definitions of IP and then shift into how it directly affects you in the acquisition world. There are many ways to categorize intellectual property. These are the main categories:

|  |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| ![ ](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/f6b3a8c6266cbe72eca1c0ab63db9c4c957b08de/Media/Module%203/Copyright.jpg)  | **Copyright** is a legal term used to describe creators' rights over their literary and artistic works. Copyrighted works include books, music, paintings, sculpture, and films, as well as computer programs, databases, advertisements, maps, and technical drawings.  |
| ![ ](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/f6b3a8c6266cbe72eca1c0ab63db9c4c957b08de/Media/Module%203/Patent.jpg)  | A **patent** is an exclusive right granted for an invention. Generally speaking, a patent gives the owner the right to decide how—or whether—others can use the invention. In exchange for this right, the patent owner makes technical information about the invention publicly available in the published patent document. |

Trademarks date back to ancient times when craftsmen used to put their signature or "mark" on their products.   |

A design may consist of three-dimensional features, such as the article's shape or surface, or two-dimensional features, such as patterns, lines, or color.   |

Most commonly, a geographical indication includes the name of the place of origin of the goods. For example, Napa Valley is an appellation in California known for its unique growing conditions for producing wine.  |


### Digital media rights

The government has put in place measures to protect all types of IP. When considering digital services, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a vital copyright law to be familiar with. DMCA is a U.S. copyright law that implements two 1996 World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) treaties. It criminalizes:

* Production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent measures (commonly known as digital rights management or DRM) that control access to copyrighted works.  
* The act of circumventing an access control, whether or not there is actual infringement of copyright itself.

In addition, the DMCA heightens the penalties for copyright infringement on the internet.

## FAR Subpart 27.4 Rights in Data and Copyrights

Digital services acquisition—particularly acquisitions involving software development or existing proprietary solutions—is substantially impacted by the contractual arrangements for data rights between the contractor and the government. These arrangements affect competition, legal liability, lifecycle costs, and related issues.

Accordingly, digital services acquisition professionals like you must be familiar with and understand FAR 27.4 and its clauses. Under FAR 27.402, and as discussed previously in this program, agencies may require data to be delivered under contracts, and the ability to use or disclose it, to:

(1) Obtain competition among suppliers;  
(2) Fulfill specific responsibilities for disseminating and publishing the results of their activities;  
(3) Ensure appropriate utilization of the results of research, development, and demonstration activities, including the dissemination of technical information to foster subsequent technological developments;  
(4) Meet other programmatic and statutory requirements; and  
(5) Meet specialized acquisition needs and ensure logistics support.

Conversely, contractors may have proprietary interests in data that provide competitive advantages in the commercial or government marketplace or both. Protection of legitimate proprietary data from unauthorized use and disclosure “…is necessary to encourage qualified contractors to participate in and apply innovative concepts to Government programs. In light of these considerations, *agencies shall balance the Government's needs and the contractor’s legitimate proprietary interests.”*

[**Video - Data Rights: Understanding and Negotiating Data Rights**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZBys4jBZOk)


### What does “data” mean, and how does it apply to data rights and copyrights?

FAR 27.401 defines data in the following ways:

* “Data” means recorded information, regardless of form or the media on which it may be recorded. The term *includes technical data and computer software*. The term *does not* *include information incidental to contract administration, such as financial, administrative, cost or pricing, or management information.*  
* “Form, fit, and function data”: For computer software, this means data identifying the source, functional characteristics, and performance requirements, but it *specifically excludes the source code, algorithms, processes, formulas, and flow charts of the software*.  
* “Restricted computer software” means computer software *developed at private expense and that is a trade secret; is commercial or financial and confidential or privileged; or is copyrighted computer software, including minor modifications of such computer software.*

While the definitions and resulting data rights under a contract may seem straightforward, many issues must be considered when deciding who (the contractor and the government) gets which type of rights to what data in any particular contract. The clauses and alternates associated with this FAR part provide a variety of arrangements and tailoring to support the government and contractor’s interests, given the particular circumstances of any digital services acquisition.

It’s important to note that in federal acquisition, the contractor is responsible for claiming proprietary data and marking it as such when delivered to the government. Absent such claims and markings, the contractor may not be able to enforce limitations on the government’s rights to that data.

When data is first produced under the performance of the contract, the government historically prefers complete contractor ownership of the data to encourage commercial development; however, the government often retains complete license to the data without fees or cost in perpetuity. While this practice was mainly for hardware, equipment, and supplies developed and delivered under contract at government expense, the principle applies to software, even software solutions developed using open source code. The potential for applying the solution, in whole or in part, to commercial markets is a powerful incentive for commercial contractors to engage in government contracts and a source of potential government leverage in negotiations.

## Contribution, Attribution, Retribution…Oh My\!

Open source means public domain, right? Short answer is…wrong. Even open-source software has licensing agreements and copyright protections. These affect how open source software is developed, used, maintained, upgraded, and when used to develop custom software, the IP rights of the developer. The Business Software Alliance's “Open Source and Commercial Software \- An In-Depth Analysis” paper is an excellent primer for this issue and many others related to IP in open source software. The paper describes open source and IP as follows:

*“Open Source” is a software-licensing model where the software's source code is typically made royalty-free to the software users, under terms allowing redistribution, modification, and addition, though often with certain restrictions. The support, training, updates, and other services for the software may be provided by a range of entities, increasingly under commercial arrangements. Open source programs are often, though not exclusively, developed through a collaborative effort in which several persons contribute elements of the final software. Software companies also contribute paid programmer time and in-house programs to the open source community.”*

So, how does this affect the government's acquisition of professionals? The data rights arena directly affects what the custom software developer can claim as restricted data or proprietary software in the delivered solution. Because open source code can be integrated with proprietary software in developing a solution, it also impacts the type, magnitude, and level of open software components the contractor may incorporate. For a better understanding, let’s look at the two main types of open software licensing agreements typically in use today.

### GNU General Public License (GPL)

Developers using open source software under a GPL cannot sell “derivative” works they develop from the software at more than the nominal distribution cost. Because the source code is subject to the GPL in the solution, both the developer and the customer are subject to the terms of the GPL for the source code of that derivative work. This means the customer can make copies and distribute the software to as many people or agencies as desired with no additional payments due to the developer. 

While this presents a problem for the contractor in making its developed solution commercially viable, the contractor can charge what the market will bear for setup, installation, training, and other services supporting the software installation and operation.

The GPL is not a standard, one-size-fits-all document, and there are more than a few variants established by organizations that control open source software to fit their commercial, cultural, and mission needs.

### Berkley Software Distribution (BSD) License

Open source software subject to the BSD License is more easily converted to a commercially viable product for developers because they can integrate their own source code and then market and distribute the resulting software under more traditional IP and commercial software licensing arrangements.

Digital services acquisition professionals like you should understand these two licensing arrangements regarding government rights in data and the proposed solution(s) to be acquired. While the effectiveness of the proposed/contracted solution for the agency’s mission is paramount, licensing agreements can affect IP claims, which will in turn affect sustainment and maintenance, and access and rights to data (including the cost of distributing the software solution to other agencies or components).

## Who Owns Open Source Code?

As covered in the previous section, open source doesn’t necessarily mean public domain. In addition, ownership of software solutions developed from open source platforms depends significantly on the terms of the licensing agreement issued by the controlling organization and the terms and conditions of the contract under which the government acquired it. 

If you interpret ownership as the ability to control something, then the range and depth of that control define effective ownership. Complete “ownership” of open source will never truly be attained by the government since the open source code is managed and maintained by the controlling organization (e.g., Mozilla, Ruby on Rails), in joint ownership with the contributors, under the terms of the applicable licensing agreement.

However, the licensing agreement, together with the negotiated terms and conditions of the contract, can provide the government with sufficient control to support the acquisition requirements, both long-term and short-term.

From previous content and discussion in the program, we know that open source can offer a path to effective software solutions without the IP issues and cost of proprietary solutions. In effect, it can provide effective government control and ownership of the solution.

The principle of First Performance is also key. Generally, when the software solution is first developed under a government contract at government expense, the government gets unrestricted rights to the solution. However, it is rarely as clean as that. The software solution may incorporate First Performance data with open source (GPL or BSD) and previously developed proprietary (restricted) software. Ownership of the data and IP assignment gets more complicated in such conditions.

The data rights clauses prescribed in FAR Part 27 allow for establishing the parties' data rights and ownership, as well as mechanisms for asserting those rights in the contract. However, suppose the government asserts the need for specific government rights for parts of, or the entirety of, the solution. In that case, that needs to be established in the solicitation, made a condition for source selection, negotiated, and memorialized in the resulting contract requirements and clauses. To the maximum extent possible, both parties should understand the government's and contractor's IP and data rights going in to minimize problems later.

## Data in the Cloud (It’s Cloudy Out There\!)

What about data in the cloud? Here are some common questions and answers about such data.

### Q: If I store my data in the cloud, does that make it public?

A: No. Just as commercial sector customers using cloud services expect security and privacy for the data or content stored in the cloud, the government also has that reasonable expectation. Supporting that expectation is the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FEDRAMP), which supports the certification and listing of cloud providers who meet strict security and reliability requirements for content stored in their infrastructure.

### Q: Does storing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in the cloud mean I don’t have to get authorization to establish a database with PII?

A: No. The statutory requirements for establishing a system or database that collects or stores PII cannot be circumvented, regardless of where that system or database resides. If archiving functions or processing are moved to the cloud, a complete approval process for a system may be required, or merely certification that the repository is secure. Consult your HR, Security, and Agency Counsel.

### Q: If my custom software solution is deployed in a cloud service (SaaS), does that mean the government can’t get unlimited data rights for the software?

A: No, cloud storage has no impact on data rights.

### Q: My custom software solution and corresponding database are in the cloud. Does it have to stay that way? What if I need to switch development contractors down the road?

A: No. Assuming the government obtained rights in the custom solution (which they should), they can choose to store it wherever they want. The complication here is that if the solution was developed to operate in the cloud, it may be financially or time-prohibitive to move it.
