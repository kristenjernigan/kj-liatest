# Module 2B Self-Paced

## Responsible Pre-Solicitation Communication

### Introduction
The Federal government spends over $500 billion each year on goods and services. As an acquisition professional, you have an obligation to complete every procurement youâ€™re involved in as effectively, efficiently, and responsibly as possible. Pre-solicitation communication with vendors in the target market is recommended in order to access current market information and define requirements as clearly as possible. Ideally, it should begin well before the issuing of a solicitation.

There are two goals or purposes to this interaction. First, the government hopes to improve their end results by obtaining as much information and knowledge as possible regarding possibilities from vendors prior to preparing a solicitation. Secondly, the government wants to know how to better communicate and increase vendor understanding of the need, in the hopes that they will receive better informed offers.

While the FAR allows for a good deal of flexibility in establishing pre-solicitation communication with potential vendors, some agencies are reluctant to exercise all of their options. They fear stepping over the line and drawing protests or potentially compromising procurement integrity. Vendors may also be reluctant to discuss requirements and solutions in the presence of potential competitors and may fear that talking privately to an agency could limit their future opportunities. However, especially in the world of digital services procurement, open pre-solicitation communication with potential vendors is critical. Why is that the case? And how do you execute it effectively? You'll learn the answers to these questions by completing this online learning.
