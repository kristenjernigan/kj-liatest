# Module 2B Self-Paced

## Responsible Pre-Solicitation Communication

### Introduction
The Federal government spends over $500 billion yearly on goods and services. As an acquisition professional, you must complete every procurement you’re involved in as effectively, efficiently, and responsibly as possible. Pre-solicitation communication with vendors in the target market is recommended to access current market information and define requirements as clearly as possible. Ideally, it should begin well before the issuing of a solicitation.

There are two goals or purposes to this interaction. First, the government hopes to improve its results by obtaining as much information and knowledge as possible regarding possibilities from vendors before preparing a solicitation. Second, the government wants to know how to communicate better and increase vendor understanding of the need, hoping that will lead to better-informed offers.

While the FAR allows for a good deal of flexibility in establishing pre-solicitation communication with potential vendors, some agencies are reluctant to exercise all of their options. They fear stepping over the line and drawing protests or compromising procurement integrity. Vendors may also be reluctant to discuss requirements and solutions in the presence of potential competitors and may fear that talking privately to an agency could limit their future opportunities. However, open pre-solicitation communication with potential vendors is critical, especially in digital services procurement. Why is that the case? And how do you execute it effectively? You’ll learn the answers to these questions by completing this online learning.
