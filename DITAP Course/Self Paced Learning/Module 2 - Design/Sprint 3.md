# Module 2 Sprint 3

## Defining Success for Your Digital Services Acquisition

### Overview

Effective digital services acquisition begins long before the first contract document is drafted. It starts with understanding the problem, aligning stakeholders, and translating discovery insights into a strategy that delivers real mission outcomes. This module—**“From** **Discovery to Strategy”**—equips acquisition professionals to make that critical shift.

By leveraging early research, user interviews, and process mapping, contracting and program teams can co-create acquisition strategies that are flexible, user-centered, and outcome-driven. Rather than repeating legacy approaches or writing rigid contracts to avoid risk, this module encourages a mindset of adaptability**,** collaboration, and alignment—core principles of modern digital service delivery.

Success in digital services doesn’t start with a delivery milestone—it starts with shared clarity. What problem are we solving? For whom? How will we know we’ve done it well? This section walks through how to define success that helps teams stay aligned, responsive to change, and focused on outcomes, not just outputs.

This module emphasizes the strategic role of the acquisition professiona**l** in shaping not just the contract, but the success of the entire digital service. By applying these concepts, learners will gain the tools and language to build acquisitions that are not only compliant but truly impactful.

#### Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to: 

* Define a user-centered problem statement that avoids pre-defined solutions but aligns with user pain points.  
* Draft a product vision statement using structured facilitation questions to describe the desired future state.  
* Facilitate a product visioning session that engages stakeholders in clarifying goals and success outcomes.

* Link product vision to procurement objectives and measurable success metrics using the RoM framework.  
* Differentiate between features and outcomes when writing acquisition objectives and evaluation criteria.  
* Recognize common pitfalls in early acquisition planning (e.g., vague goals, prescriptive requirements).  
* Conduct a constraint discovery session to identify operational, technical, or policy-based acquisition limits.  
* Apply identified constraints to shape acquisition strategies, contract types, timelines, and evaluation methods.  
* Use discovery data and documented tradeoffs to defend and adapt acquisition decisions throughout the lifecycle.
