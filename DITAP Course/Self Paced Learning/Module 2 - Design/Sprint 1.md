## Introduction to Assessing Agency Readiness

Before an agency embarks on a digital service acquisition, it must first understand its own readiness to support the demands of modern, agile procurement. In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, success isn't just about selecting the right technology or vendor—it’s about aligning acquisition strategies with an agency’s internal capabilities, culture, governance, and tolerance for change. This learning unit focuses on helping participants assess and understand these internal factors so they can make strategic decisions that reduce risk and enhance outcomes.

Drawing from real-world case studies and frameworks, including maturity models and readiness surveys, this unit guides learners through the foundational steps of gauging organizational readiness. Participants will explore how elements like agile adoption, stakeholder alignment, procurement agility, and leadership support can directly influence the success of a digital acquisition. By the end, learners will be equipped to evaluate readiness not just as a bureaucratic checkbox, but as a strategic advantage in designing executable, scalable acquisition strategies.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, participants will be able to:

* Define what agency maturity means in the context of digital services acquisition

* Explain how organizational readiness impacts procurement strategy and risk

* Use change and innovation readiness tools to evaluate internal capabilities

* Identify common gaps in digital service maturity and find strategies to address them

* Assess when and how to incorporate open source, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), or proprietary solutions based on agency context

* Engage stakeholders effectively based on agency culture, governance, and decision-making dynamics

* Apply a maturity-aligned framework to shape acquisition strategies that are executable, adaptable, and mission-focused
