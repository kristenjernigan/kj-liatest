## Introduction to Conducting Effective Market Research

Effective market research is the cornerstone of a successful digital services acquisition. It provides the critical insights needed to align government needs with real-world capabilities and ensures the resulting solicitations are grounded in an understanding of current technologies, vendor landscapes, and user expectations. In today’s fast-paced digital environment, traditional approaches to research often fall short—requiring a shift toward more agile, creative, and user-informed techniques.

This unit equips acquisition professionals with the tools, methods, and mindset needed to conduct meaningful market research. Learners will explore resources like the Gartner Magic Quadrant, discover unconventional data sources such as open GitHub repositories and Reddit communities, and develop a personalized Acquisition Toolkit to capture ideas, tools, and strategies for future use. By blending structured analysis with flexible exploration, participants will learn to generate actionable intelligence that supports smart, user-centered procurement decisions.
