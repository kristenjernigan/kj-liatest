## Introduction to Conducting Effective Market Research

Effective market research is the cornerstone of a successful digital services acquisition. It provides the critical insights needed to align government needs with real-world capabilities and ensures the resulting solicitations are grounded in an understanding of current technologies, vendor landscapes, and user expectations. In today’s fast-paced digital environment, traditional approaches to research often fall short—requiring a shift toward more agile, creative, and user-informed techniques.

This unit equips acquisition professionals with the tools, methods, and mindset needed to conduct meaningful market research. Learners will explore resources like the Gartner Magic Quadrant, discover unconventional data sources such as open GitHub repositories and Reddit communities, and develop a personalized Acquisition Toolkit to capture ideas, tools, and strategies for future use. By blending structured analysis with flexible exploration, participants will learn to generate actionable intelligence that supports smart, user-centered procurement decisions.

## **Responsible Pre-Solicitation Communication**

### Introduction

The Federal government spends over $500 billion yearly on goods and services. As an acquisition professional, you must complete every procurement you’re involved in as effectively, efficiently, and responsibly as possible to ensure taxpayer money is well-spent. One strategy that facilitates effective procurement is pre-solicitation communication. Pre-solicitation communication with vendors in the target market can help you access current market information and define requirements as clearly as possible. Ideally, it should begin well before the issuing of a solicitation.

There are two goals to this interaction: 

1. To improve procurement outcomes by obtaining as much information as possible regarding potential solutions from vendors before preparing a solicitation  
2.  To better communicate government needs to vendors, so they will provide better-informed offers.

While the FAR allows for a good deal of flexibility in establishing pre-solicitation communication with potential vendors, some agencies are reluctant to exercise all of their options. They fear stepping over the line and causing protests or compromising procurement integrity. Vendors may also be reluctant to discuss requirements and solutions in the presence of potential competitors or may fear that talking privately to an agency could limit their future opportunities. However, open pre-solicitation communication with potential vendors is critical, especially in digital services procurement. Why is that the case? And how do you execute it effectively? You’ll learn the answers to these questions by completing this online learning.

#### Module Overview

* Discuss why pre-solicitation communication with offerors is essential in acquiring digital services.  
  * Describe ways you can communicate effectively with potential vendors before solicitation of digital services.  
  * Identify best practices for responsible pre-solicitation communication when procuring digital services.
