## Introduction to Conducting Effective Market Research

Effective market research is the cornerstone of a successful digital services acquisition. It provides the critical insights needed to align government needs with real-world capabilities and ensures the resulting solicitations are grounded in an understanding of current technologies, vendor landscapes, and user expectations. In today’s fast-paced digital environment, traditional approaches to research often fall short—requiring a shift toward more agile, creative, and user-informed techniques.

This unit equips acquisition professionals with the tools, methods, and mindset needed to conduct meaningful market research. Learners will explore resources like the Gartner Magic Quadrant, discover unconventional data sources such as open GitHub repositories and Reddit communities, and develop a personalized Acquisition Toolkit to capture ideas, tools, and strategies for future use. By blending structured analysis with flexible exploration, participants will learn to generate actionable intelligence that supports smart, user-centered procurement decisions.

## **Responsible Pre-Solicitation Communication**

### Introduction

The Federal government spends over $500 billion yearly on goods and services. As an acquisition professional, you must complete every procurement you’re involved in as effectively, efficiently, and responsibly as possible to ensure taxpayer money is well-spent. One strategy that facilitates effective procurement is pre-solicitation communication. Pre-solicitation communication with vendors in the target market can help you access current market information and define requirements as clearly as possible. Ideally, it should begin well before the issuing of a solicitation.

There are two goals to this interaction: 

1. To improve procurement outcomes by obtaining as much information as possible regarding potential solutions from vendors before preparing a solicitation  
2.  To better communicate government needs to vendors, so they will provide better-informed offers. 

![The White House and a city connected by an arrow reading, "Information"](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/70eed689917b7c8b58b0673c3421318c028d4754/Media/Module%202B/Govt%20Vendor%20Information%20Sharing.png) 

While the FAR allows for a good deal of flexibility in establishing pre-solicitation communication with potential vendors, some agencies are reluctant to exercise all of their options. They fear stepping over the line and causing protests or compromising procurement integrity. Vendors may also be reluctant to discuss requirements and solutions in the presence of potential competitors or may fear that talking privately to an agency could limit their future opportunities. However, open pre-solicitation communication with potential vendors is critical, especially in digital services procurement. Why is that the case? And how do you execute it effectively? You’ll learn the answers to these questions by completing this online learning.

#### Module Overview

After completing this module, you should be able to: 

* Discuss why pre-solicitation communication with offerors is essential in acquiring digital services.  
  * Describe ways you can communicate effectively with potential vendors before solicitation of digital services.  
  * Identify best practices for responsible pre-solicitation communication when procuring digital services.

## **Engaging the industry traditionally**

The more “traditional” ways to engage with industry also have a place. These include pre-solicitation notices, draft RFPs, RFIs, pre-solicitation or pre-proposal conferences, and site visits. The Myth-Busting memo referred to at the beginning of this module offers the following suggestions on these topics:

* **Requests for Information (RFIs):** Issue an RFI to ensure the government understands the industry's capabilities and can develop or improve its acquisition strategy regarding contract type, performance requirements, performance work statements/statements of work, and performance metrics. Although not required, sometimes releasing a draft Request for Proposal (RFP), including sections L and M, ensures clear solicitation instructions. Get feedback from the industry on whether the evaluation instructions are clear or what could make them better performance indicators.  
*  **Industry days:** Industry days are hosted by government agencies and offer a forum where vendors can learn more about pending procurements, identify potential partners and competitors, and interact and build relationships with government personnel. Such events can encourage competition and create a level playing field for all potential offerors. See the [ACT-IAC Report: Industry Day Best Practices for more guidelines on conducting an Industry Day](https://www.actiac.org/groups/document/industry-day-best-practices-white-paper-122014).

  * **One-on-one communications:** As valuable as industry days can be, there are times when one-on-one communication may be more valuable. Vendors may be reluctant to expose their techniques or approaches to competitors. In private oral or written communications, the government can protect proprietary information and thus encourage vendors to share more.  
  * **Agency opportunity forecast:** Many agencies post advanced procurement plans and upcoming opportunities on their websites. Often, this includes a variety of background documents and information that the industry can use to understand better the agency's mission and specific acquisition needs well before specific individual actions. The industry can be given opportunities to respond and provide valuable feedback in crafting and refining requirements.

### **Evolving market research for digital services**

While they can still be used and are often required by acquisition strategy, traditional government RFIs often create unnecessary barriers for modern digital service providers. The burdensome processes can discourage the very vendors you want to engage—especially small, agile companies and non-traditional government vendors delivering high-quality tech services.

**Key concepts:**

* **Adapt to digital delivery realities:**  
  Digital services require flexibility, speed, and iteration. Forcing companies into rigid government templates or overly complex RFIs slows acquisitions and alienates top performers.

* **Streamline the approach:**  
  Don’t default to the RFI template. Align your market research format with the complexity of the solicitation. For simple needs, consider lighter-touch methods: video responses, virtual industry days, or facilitated roundtables.

* **Ask smarter questions:**  
  Avoid boilerplate checklists. Instead, ask about predictability in iterative delivery.  
  How does the company handle failure or pivots? Ask them to provide real examples of managing risk and client expectations.  
  Be wary of vendors claiming perfection—true partners acknowledge uncertainty and plan for it.

* **Watch for AI-filled answers:**  
  With AI now able to auto-fill generic responses, acquisition professionals must intentionally structure questions to reveal authentic capability, not just polished language. Use AI to support the process, but also be aware of overreliance. 

**Bottom Line:**  
Effective market research is about getting real insight, not compliance. Be thoughtful, be flexible, and design your research to surface true digital delivery capability, not just who can fill out the most forms.

## 3\. Explore other promising alternatives and approaches 

As the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) continues to evolve, driven partly by new Executive Orders from the White House, procurement guidance is shifting toward a more flexible, modular approach. In this new era, we can expect to see more “ordering guides” and implementation policies that exist alongside, but are distinct from, the core statutes that must be followed. This creates a critical opportunity for acquisition professionals to think beyond rigid templates and embrace creative, compliant ways to conduct market research and shape solicitations. One powerful approach is to bring the vendor community into the early stages of requirement development and evaluation design. This method, used widely by other governments and increasingly piloted in the U.S., includes tools like open contracting workshops, prototype competitions via Challenge.gov, and collaborative drafting through platforms like GitHub. These practices help ensure solicitations are grounded in real-world capability and modern delivery approaches—before they’re even released.

### Open contracting standards in Canada and Europe

Canada has been a pioneer in adopting open contracting principles. In 2014, it incorporated open contracting into its national action plan, leading to the publication of pilot datasets using the Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS). The Treasury Board Secretariat is working towards implementing a Proactive Disclosure policy to provide timely and standardized open data on public contracting. Cities like Montreal have also begun publishing open contracting data, enhancing transparency and civic engagement.​

Europe, particularly the European Union (EU), has integrated open contracting into its procurement processes. The EU has aligned its eForms for public procurement notices with the OCDS to standardize data publication. Member states like Italy and Finland have received funding to implement OCDS in their contract registers, promoting transparency and efficiency in public procurement.​

### Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) open contracting approach

The NMAAHC has embraced open contracting methods to enhance transparency and collaboration. For instance, in 2021, it issued a Request for Quote (RFQ) for Digital Archives Specialist services, detailing the scope of work, evaluation criteria, and performance periods. Additionally, the museum maintains a GitHub repository, promoting open access to its digital assets and encouraging community engagement in its projects. The NMAAHC sets a precedent for transparent and collaborative procurement processes in cultural institutions by leveraging platforms like GitHub and adhering to open contracting standards.

## Understand the cost-benefit and tradeoffs

When considering your market research approach, it's essential to consider not only what you want to learn but also what it costs the industry to answer your questions. Every time the government issues an RFI, hosts an industry day, or releases a draft solicitation, vendors must dedicate time and resources to responding. And for industry, time is money.

While large firms may absorb these costs as part of doing business, for small businesses, new entrants, and non-traditional vendors, this can be a significant burden, especially when the timelines to award stretch into months or even years. These costs show up in corporate overhead, impact pricing structures, and can deter companies from participating in future procurements altogether. In effect, overly burdensome market research doesn't just raise costs—it can shrink your vendor pool and reduce competition.

So how can we streamline? Start by asking:

* Am I requesting anything duplicative?  
   Check if another agency has already done similar market research. Collaborate or borrow instead of duplicating effort. This helps reduce the government-wide burden on industry.

* Can I learn what I need in a lighter-touch way?  
   Instead of complex narratives or long-form white papers, use tools like brief surveys (even Google Forms), short video submissions, or structured Q\&A sessions.

* Am I making the timeline clear?  
   Many companies leave when they realize that a procurement might take 12–18 months before contract award. Use your market research to set expectations and provide transparency around the process and timeline.

* Does this question need to be answered by the vendor community?  
   Sometimes, the data you seek already exists—in past awards, case studies, or government dashboards. Or it might be better answered by talking to a few experts rather than releasing a public RFI.

* Can I reduce response friction?  
   Keep submission instructions simple. Avoid requiring specialized formats, excessive page limits, or hard-to-follow templates. Be human-centered in how you request input.

Ultimately, every RFI or engagement comes at a cost to industry, especially for the small, diverse, and mission-driven companies we want to encourage. Being intentional and efficient with your approach isn't just good stewardship—it’s smart acquisition.

###  Scenario 1: The 60-Page RFI that no one could answer

Background:  
 In 2023, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued [a Request for Information (RFI) for an Investigative Case Management (ICM) system](https://sam.gov/opp/7e20d6751a0e4a97be276139b8bcecad/view). The RFI was comprehensive, requesting detailed technical narratives, staffing plans, past performance examples, and pricing breakdowns—all within a tight 10-day turnaround. ​

Impact on industry:

* Small businesses and non-traditional vendors found it challenging to allocate resources to respond adequately within the given timeframe.​

* Several innovative companies unfamiliar with federal procurement processes were deterred by the complexity and depth of the information requested.​

* Only a few large integrators responded, many of whom repurposed content from previous submissions, offering limited innovation tailored to DHS's specific needs.​

Student Reflection Questions:

1. Who is likely to respond to an RFI like this, and who is likely to opt out? Why?

2. What assumptions did the agency make about vendor capacity and procurement timelines?

3. How would this RFI affect your engagement decision if you were a small business?

4. What information in this RFI might the agency have gathered more efficiently through other means (e.g., website reviews, past procurements, short vendor meetings)?

5. What changes could have made this RFI more accessible while still gathering meaningful data?

6. What downstream impacts could this RFI have on pricing, quality, and diversity of competition?

7. What would a more human-centered or tech-aware version of this RFI look like?

Result:  
 The agency received generic responses that didn't reflect the current state of the market or modern solutions. They missed out on input from more agile, cost-effective vendors. Moreover, the time and resources expended by vendors were eventually passed back to the government in the form of higher prices.​

Lesson:  
 Instead of requesting extensive narratives and detailed pricing for undefined work, the agency could have hosted a focused industry listening session, followed by a simplified survey or form to gather essential information. This approach would have widened participation and provided a more accurate picture of market capabilities, reducing costs for all parties involved.

### Scenario 2: Open tech challenge yields better results

Background:  
 In 2010, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) launched [the Online Public Access (OPA) prototype](https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2011/nr11-35.html) as part of its Open Government Plan. Rather than issuing a traditional RFI and extensive Performance Work Statement (PWS), NARA engaged the public and developer community through collaborative platforms, including GitHub, to develop and refine the prototype. ​

Impact on industry:

* Numerous small and non-traditional vendors participated, including civic tech nonprofits and small commercial SaaS firms.​

* Companies invested in building real, working prototypes because the timeline was clear, and the cost of entry was low.​

* Without requiring formal submissions or GSA schedules, NARA gained direct insight into user experience, technical feasibility, and potential partners.​

Student Reflection Questions: 

* What barriers to entry were removed using an open challenge instead of a traditional RFI?

* How did the format of the engagement help uncover actual capability instead of marketing language?

* What risks did NARA take using this approach, and how were those risks managed or mitigated?

* How could this model be adapted for other types of federal procurements? What wouldn’t work in every context?

* How might non-traditional vendors perceive this process compared to a typical SAM.gov posting?

* What mechanisms allowed NARA to build trust with the vendor community before formal procurement began?

* What lessons from this approach could you bring into your next market research planning session?

Result:  
 The winning concept came from a vendor who had never worked with the federal government before but offered a more modern and intuitive solution than legacy vendors. NARA was able to move quickly to refine its scope and run a targeted follow-on procurement that saved time and money.​

Lesson:  
 By designing the market research around demonstration rather than documentation, NARA engaged a broader market and avoided the overhead costs (for both government and vendors) of traditional RFIs. They didn't just find vendors—they built relationships and trust in the process.​

---

These scenarios underscore the importance of thoughtful market research design. By considering the burdens placed on vendors, especially small and non-traditional ones, agencies can foster greater participation, encourage innovation, and ultimately procure more effective solutions.

## Conclusion 

### Applying human-centered design to market research in federal acquisition

Human-centered design (HCD) isn’t just for product development—it can (and should) be applied to the acquisition process, especially in the critical early stage of market research. We can build a more effective and inclusive buying process by centering the needs, behaviors, and constraints of the vendor community, procurement staff, and program stakeholders.

#### Start with empathy—even after the RFI closes

Most government RFIs go out with little follow-up or feedback once the window closes. But this is a missed opportunity for learning. Using HCD principles, we should treat RFIs as two-way engagements, not just data collection exercises.

Here’s how:

* Follow up with respondents to ask about their experience. What was easy? What was unclear? Did the questions help them understand what you need?  
* Reach out to companies you expected but didn’t hear from. Ask: Why didn’t they respond? Was it the timeline, format, unclear objectives, or something else?  
* These simple feedback loops help you understand what the market can do and how your processes shape who chooses to participate.

#### Hold a retrospective with your procurement team

After every significant market research activity, bring your team together for a 15–30 minute retrospective using a simple "traffic light" format:

**Keep doing**: What worked well that we should repeat?

**Change or improve**: What felt clunky or unclear?

**Stop doing**: What created friction or added unnecessary burden?

This format helps normalize reflection and ensures everyone—contracting, program, and technical—can speak a common language. Applying digital service thinking to your acquisition approach builds internal trust, improves communication, and leads to better, more actionable outcomes.

### Leveraging AI to Enhance Productivity in Federal Market Research

#### Introduction: The challenge

As discussed, Federal acquisition professionals often face tight deadlines, complex regulations, and limited resources. Traditional market research methods—such as drafting RFIs, analyzing vendor responses, and preparing documentation—are time-consuming and labor-intensive. These processes can lead to delays in procurement cycles and increased workloads for already overburdened staff.​

#### The solution: Integrating AI tools

Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools offer a transformative solution to streamline market research activities. By automating routine tasks, AI can free up valuable time, reduce errors, and enhance the quality of procurement decisions. 

Importantly, AI isn’t here to steal your job but to help you keep your sanity. Think of it as the junior contract specialist you’re training up: eager, fast, sometimes a little too confident, but ultimately helpful in handling the busy work you don’t have time for. You’re still the decision-maker, with the judgment, experience, and authority to guide the acquisition. The checks and balances of the procurement process still apply, and no AI tool is signing anything on your behalf. But if you need help sorting responses, drafting first-pass documents, or chasing down that one clause you can never remember—AI’s your overenthusiastic intern who *never* takes a lunch break.

#### Key areas where AI enhances market research

**1\. Drafting and reviewing documents**

Traditional approach:

* Depending on their complexity, manually drafting RFIs, market research reports, and other procurement documents can take several hours to days.​

AI-enhanced approach:

* AI tools like ChatGPT, Co-Pilot, Gemini, or Claude can generate initial drafts of documents in minutes, which professionals can then review and customize.​

Time savings:

* Studies have shown that AI can reduce document drafting time by up to 80%, allowing staff to reallocate time to higher-value tasks.

**2\. Analyzing vendor responses**

Traditional approach:

* Reviewing and synthesizing responses from multiple vendors is a manual process that can take days, especially for large procurements.​

AI-enhanced approach:

* AI can quickly analyze large volumes of text, identify key themes, and summarize vendor capabilities, facilitating, but not replacing, faster decision-making.​

Time savings:

* AI-assisted analysis can increase throughput by approximately 66%, significantly reducing the time required for comprehensive reviews.

**3\. Conducting market research**

Traditional approach:

* Gathering information on potential vendors and market capabilities often involves extensive manual research.​

AI-enhanced approach:

* AI tools can aggregate and analyze data from various sources, providing insights into vendor performance, market trends, and potential risks.​

Time savings:

* Implementing AI in market research can improve productivity by up to 40%, enabling faster and more informed procurement decisions.

### Top AI security \+ integrity considerations for acquisition professionals

**1\. Sensitive data can be exposed in public AI tools**

DO NOT input proprietary, confidential, procurement-sensitive, or personally identifiable information (PII) into public AI tools (like free versions of ChatGPT or Bard).  
 Why? Some platforms use what you type to train their models, meaning your info could live on beyond your session.

Use AI tools approved by your agency or ensure your tool has a “no data retention” policy or private model settings.

---

**2\. Hallucinations are real (and annoying)**

What’s a hallucination? It’s when an AI confidently makes something up and passes it off as fact, like citing a non-existent FAR clause or quoting a policy that doesn’t exist.  
 AI doesn’t *know* things—it predicts plausible answers based on patterns in the data it was trained on.

Always verify AI-generated content, especially concerning regulations, law, or pricing. AI is a helpful co-pilot, not a final authority.

---

**3\. Model biases can skew results**

AI tools reflect the data they’re trained on, and that data might carry biases, such as favoring certain vendors, tech solutions, or assumptions about what “good performance” looks like.

Be mindful of potential bias in AI outputs, especially when comparing vendors or analyzing performance data. Use AI for synthesis, but maintain human judgment for fairness.

---

**4\. Version drift and inconsistent output**

AI tools change frequently—what you get today may be slightly different tomorrow. Model updates can affect tone, structure, and even the accuracy of responses.

Save outputs you plan to use. Don’t assume you’ll get the same response twice—AI doesn’t have a memory unless you give it one.

---

**5\. AI can reinforce bad inputs**

If your prompt is vague, incorrect, or biased, the AI will roll with it—and might make things worse. For example:  
 “Write a justification for this sole-source award” will return a different answer than:  
 “Assess if a sole-source justification aligns with FAR 6.302 guidance.”

Prompt engineering matters—how you ask a question influences what you get back. Be clear, specific, and ask for sources when needed.

---

**6\. Output may not be audit-ready**

AI can help you draft documents, summaries, and reports—but you’re still responsible for accuracy, compliance, and traceability.

Always double-check final outputs, and don’t submit AI-generated work as-is. Think of AI as a strong first draft machine, not a compliance tool.

---

**7\. Follow your agency’s IT and privacy policies**

Some agencies are adopting AI use policies that govern what tools can be used, what kinds of data can be input, and how outputs are handled.

Check your agency's policy before using any AI tool or talk to your IT/security lead.

---

### Final thought:

AI can be like the world’s fastest intern—helpful but unreliable. You’re still the Contracting Officer, COR, or Specialist in charge. Use AI to speed up your work—but never let it replace your judgment.

---

Agencies need to understand what the market can provide to acquire the best digital service solutions they can afford. Appropriate communication with potential vendors is key to gaining this understanding. 

In this module, we’ve shown that pre-solicitation communication with vendors is not only allowed but desirable, and there are many different ways to engage with offerors effectively.

OMB has outlined [specific steps for obtaining and utilizing](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/procurement/memo/acquisition-360-improving-acquisition-process-timely-feedback-external-internal-stakeholders.pdf) employee and industry feedback regarding the acquisition process to continually motivate and encourage agencies to assess and improve vendor engagement practices. As you read, ask yourself what you can do as an individual acquisition professional to improve the pre-solicitation communication in your agency.

Finally, join the discussion below by responding to the following question:

How do you see pre-solicitation communication as essential to acquiring digital services? Provide an example of a situation in which communicating with vendors before solicitation significantly impacted the outcome.  

---
## Why Pre-Solicitation Communication Matters 

Now that we’ve established it’s acceptable to engage with vendors and potential end-users beyond just a Request for Information (RFI) as pre-solicitation communication, let’s explore why doing so is beneficial.  

The cartoon shows that the government may issue a clear solicitation to them, only to have vendors interpret it differently when it “hits the street.” This is the situation illustrated in the above cartoon. If you avoid situations like the one in the cartoon and keep the lines of communication open between government and industry during the pre-solicitation phase, you’ll wind up with:

1. Better requirements  
2. Better bids  
3. Increased interoperability through shared standards

Let’s look at each of these. 

**1\. Pre-solicitation communication leads to better requirements** 

Let the experts be experts. This is particularly important in the digital services industry, where technology changes daily.

Industry representatives are constantly exposed to new technologies and must be aware of changing marketplace trends. Take advantage of their expertise on digital products and services you may be procuring to discover solutions and approaches you may not be aware of.

By engaging with potential vendors early on, you can solicit their feedback on what’s possible. You might learn your ideal solution may not be the best choice. 

What is available from the industry will inform other considerations when forming your requirements. For example, are you sure you want to build a custom digital service solution, or would a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solution work with modification? These decisions will affect sustainment and maintenance. Technical data rights, intellectual property, long- and short-term costs, resources, and mission accomplishment priorities should be considered. 

**2\. Pre-solicitation communication results in better bids**

By engaging vendors in discussion and information sharing before issuing a solicitation, you condition the market to submit more constructive proposals. Vendors can’t submit good offers on what they don’t understand. Communicating about what you want to buy and sharing your vision for the contract outcome helps the industry:

* Prepare for pursuit, including finding teaming partners  
  * Decrease the overall business costs by allowing them to plan and forecast more accurately  
  * Find labor and other resources in advance rather than during the proposal.

Answering questions about the acquisition this early may seem tedious, but it will save time and money once the solicitation is released. If you release a solicitation without effective communication, you’ll be flooded with dozens of questions as industry attempts to clarify their understanding of your need. When this occurs after your solicitation has already “hit the street,” it can cause delays and extensions to the proposal due date, which is disruptive to your program and costly for industry.

**3\. Pre-solicitation communication results in shared standards and increased interoperability**

You may be operating on outdated or inappropriate standards for a particular digital services requirement. Pre-solicitation communication with industry allows vendors to tell you that and to suggest more effective and efficient alternatives for current and future requirements.

On the other hand, if you know of a standard or requirement (e.g., Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)) for an upcoming acquisition, why not publish it ahead of time rather than only include it in solicitations? Make the standards known to industry as far in advance as possible so they may incorporate them into their commercial products and other offerings.

## Knowledge Check

Answering questions about a potential acquisition from vendors before a solicitation is released may result in:

A. Delays and extensions to the due date

B. Better bids (correct)

C. Charges of unethical behavior

D. Lower costs (correct)
