## Introduction to Conducting Effective Market Research

Effective market research is the cornerstone of a successful digital services acquisition. It provides the critical insights needed to align government needs with real-world capabilities and ensures the resulting solicitations are grounded in an understanding of current technologies, vendor landscapes, and user expectations. In today’s fast-paced digital environment, traditional approaches to research often fall short—requiring a shift toward more agile, creative, and user-informed techniques.

This unit equips acquisition professionals with the tools, methods, and mindset needed to conduct meaningful market research. Learners will explore resources like the Gartner Magic Quadrant, discover unconventional data sources such as open GitHub repositories and Reddit communities, and develop a personalized Acquisition Toolkit to capture ideas, tools, and strategies for future use. By blending structured analysis with flexible exploration, participants will learn to generate actionable intelligence that supports smart, user-centered procurement decisions.

## **Responsible Pre-Solicitation Communication**

### Introduction

The Federal government spends over $500 billion yearly on goods and services. As an acquisition professional, you must complete every procurement you’re involved in as effectively, efficiently, and responsibly as possible to ensure taxpayer money is well-spent. One strategy that facilitates effective procurement is pre-solicitation communication. Pre-solicitation communication with vendors in the target market can help you access current market information and define requirements as clearly as possible. Ideally, it should begin well before the issuing of a solicitation.

There are two goals to this interaction: 

1. To improve procurement outcomes by obtaining as much information as possible regarding potential solutions from vendors before preparing a solicitation  
2.  To better communicate government needs to vendors, so they will provide better-informed offers.

While the FAR allows for a good deal of flexibility in establishing pre-solicitation communication with potential vendors, some agencies are reluctant to exercise all of their options. They fear stepping over the line and causing protests or compromising procurement integrity. Vendors may also be reluctant to discuss requirements and solutions in the presence of potential competitors or may fear that talking privately to an agency could limit their future opportunities. However, open pre-solicitation communication with potential vendors is critical, especially in digital services procurement. Why is that the case? And how do you execute it effectively? You’ll learn the answers to these questions by completing this online learning.

#### Module Overview

After completing this module, you should be able to: 

* Discuss why pre-solicitation communication with offerors is essential in acquiring digital services.  
  * Describe ways you can communicate effectively with potential vendors before solicitation of digital services.  
  * Identify best practices for responsible pre-solicitation communication when procuring digital services.

## **Engaging the industry traditionally**

The more “traditional” ways to engage with industry also have a place. These include pre-solicitation notices, draft RFPs, RFIs, pre-solicitation or pre-proposal conferences, and site visits. The Myth-Busting memo referred to at the beginning of this module offers the following suggestions on these topics:

* **Requests for Information (RFIs):** Issue an RFI to ensure the government understands the industry's capabilities and can develop or improve its acquisition strategy regarding contract type, performance requirements, performance work statements/statements of work, and performance metrics. Although not required, sometimes releasing a draft Request for Proposal (RFP), including sections L and M, ensures clear solicitation instructions. Get feedback from the industry on whether the evaluation instructions are clear or what could make them better performance indicators.  
  *  **Industry days:** Industry days are hosted by government agencies and offer a forum where vendors can learn more about pending procurements, identify potential partners and competitors, and interact and build relationships with government personnel. Such events can encourage competition and create a level playing field for all potential offerors. See the [ACT-IAC Report: Industry Day Best Practices for more guidelines on conducting an Industry Day](https://www.actiac.org/groups/document/industry-day-best-practices-white-paper-122014).

  * **One-on-one communications:** As valuable as industry days can be, there are times when one-on-one communication may be more valuable. Vendors may be reluctant to expose their techniques or approaches to competitors. In private oral or written communications, the government can protect proprietary information and thus encourage vendors to share more.  
  * **Agency opportunity forecast:** Many agencies post advanced procurement plans and upcoming opportunities on their websites. Often, this includes a variety of background documents and information that the industry can use to understand better the agency's mission and specific acquisition needs well before specific individual actions. The industry can be given opportunities to respond and provide valuable feedback in crafting and refining requirements.

### **Evolving market research for digital services**

While they can still be used and are often required by acquisition strategy, traditional government RFIs often create unnecessary barriers for modern digital service providers. The burdensome processes can discourage the very vendors you want to engage—especially small, agile companies and non-traditional government vendors delivering high-quality tech services.

**Key concepts:**

* **Adapt to digital delivery realities:**  
  Digital services require flexibility, speed, and iteration. Forcing companies into rigid government templates or overly complex RFIs slows acquisitions and alienates top performers.

* **Streamline the approach:**  
  Don’t default to the RFI template. Align your market research format with the complexity of the solicitation. For simple needs, consider lighter-touch methods: video responses, virtual industry days, or facilitated roundtables.

* **Ask smarter questions:**  
  Avoid boilerplate checklists. Instead, ask about predictability in iterative delivery.  
  How does the company handle failure or pivots? Ask them to provide real examples of managing risk and client expectations.  
  Be wary of vendors claiming perfection—true partners acknowledge uncertainty and plan for it.

* **Watch for AI-filled answers:**  
  With AI now able to auto-fill generic responses, acquisition professionals must intentionally structure questions to reveal authentic capability, not just polished language. Use AI to support the process, but also be aware of overreliance. 

**Bottom Line:**  
Effective market research is about getting real insight, not compliance. Be thoughtful, be flexible, and design your research to surface true digital delivery capability, not just who can fill out the most forms.
