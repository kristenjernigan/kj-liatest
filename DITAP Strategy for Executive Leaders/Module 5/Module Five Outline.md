# Module 5 Outline: Leading Change 
In the Leading Change module, we explore how to drive transformation within your organizations by applying proven leadership techniques that foster innovation and support a shift toward modular contracting. Through the use of storytelling and strategic communication, participants will learn how to influence key stakeholders and build momentum for change. The module highlights the tangible costs of delayed decision-making and offers tools to make timely, informed choices. Participants will analyze the formal and informal incentives that shape organizational behavior and uncover practical opportunities to move from monolithic to modular acquisition approaches. Emphasis will be placed on applying cultural transformation practices that enable agile teaming, collaboration, and a continuous improvement mindset.
