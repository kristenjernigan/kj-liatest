### Defining Digital Services
Welcome to Digital Services – The Who and The What

At the conclusion of this module, you will be able to:

- Define digital services.
- Identify key players in the digital services ecosystem. 
#### The Who and the What
Let’s start with the WHAT. What is meant by digital services? That is, in fact, the question. It cannot be defined by one simple noun or even one simple sentence. To define digital services, we need to ask ourselves more questions: who, what, why, where, and how?

Below you will find the Digital Service Wheel.  Each part of this wheel lists more than one answer to each question above, and the answers shown here are just the beginning. This is why defining digital services can be a complex task.

### The Digital Services Ecosystem

__DIGITAL SERVICES DEVELOPERS (IN-HOUSE)__

Who is needed depends on the scope and type of digital service (architects, security pros, testers, deployment engineers).

__DIGITAL SERVICES DEVELOPERS (PROFESSIONAL SERVICE VENDORS)__

When outside help is needed, the organization (private sector or government sector) works with contracting officers to procure support. Contracting officers (like you!) understand how to evaluate third-party technical competency so members of the organization can be paired with vendors who are good at both building and delivering effective digital services. 

The multi-disciplinary teams that design and develop digital services could include the following roles:
